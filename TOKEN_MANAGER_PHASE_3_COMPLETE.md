# Token Manager Upgrade - Integration & Phase 3 Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Completed in This Session

### 🔌 VTTSession Integration (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Connect TokenManager Active tab features to parent components

**Completed**:
- ✅ Added `cameraCenterRef` to VTTSession for camera control
- ✅ Added `handleCenterCamera` function in MapCanvas
  - Calculates viewport position to center on coordinates
  - Updates stagePos to center camera
  - Exposes function via ref callback pattern
- ✅ Connected TokenManager to camera centering
  - `onCenterCamera` prop passes coordinates to MapCanvas
  - Works for both tokens and lights
- ✅ Connected TokenManager to light editing
  - `onOpenLightEditor` prop opens existing lighting panel
  - Also centers camera on the light being edited
- ✅ Connected token selection
  - `onTokenSelect` prop updates selectedTokenId in VTTSession

**Integration Code Added**:
```javascript
// VTTSession.jsx
const cameraCenterRef = useRef(null);
const [selectedLight, setSelectedLight] = useState(null);

// TokenManager props
onCenterCamera={(x, y) => {
  if (cameraCenterRef.current) {
    cameraCenterRef.current(x, y);
  }
}}
onOpenLightEditor={(light) => {
  setSelectedLight(light);
  setShowLightingPanel(true);
  if (light.position && cameraCenterRef.current) {
    cameraCenterRef.current(light.position.x, light.position.y);
  }
}}
onTokenSelect={setSelectedTokenId}

// MapCanvas props
onCenterCamera={cameraCenterRef}
```

### 💡 Phase 3: Light Token Selectability (COMPLETE)
**Goal**: Make lights clickable and selectable on the canvas

**Completed**:
- ✅ Updated `LightingLayer.jsx` with new props:
  - `selectedLightId` - ID of currently selected light
  - `onLightClick` - Callback when light is clicked
  - `isDM` - Only DMs can interact with lights
- ✅ Added visual center marker for each light
  - Filled circle with light color
  - White border for visibility
  - 12px radius clickable area
  - Inner white dot (6px) for precise location
- ✅ Added selection indicator
  - Blue dashed ring (#4a9eff)
  - 20px radius around selected light
  - Dash pattern: 8px line, 4px gap
  - Only visible when light is selected
- ✅ Added click handlers
  - `onClick` and `onTap` for touch support
  - `cancelBubble` to prevent stage clicks
  - Cursor changes to pointer on hover
- ✅ Updated `MapCanvas.jsx`
  - Added `selectedLightId` state
  - Added `handleLightClick` handler
  - Toggle selection (click again to deselect)
  - Deselects token when light selected
  - Passes props to LightingLayer

**Result**: DMs can now click lights to select them, see a blue ring indicator, and interact with them via context menus or the light editor!

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Token Manager Active Tab
1. Click Token Manager button in VTT
2. Navigate to Active tab
3. See all deployed tokens listed with preview images
4. See all lights listed with glowing indicators
5. Click 🎯 Focus button on any token → Camera centers on that token
6. Click 🎯 Focus button on any light → Camera centers on that light
7. Click ✏️ Edit button on token → Switches to Palette tab with token selected
8. Click ✏️ Edit button on light → Opens Lighting Panel centered on that light

### Light Selection on Canvas (DM Only)
1. Lights now show a visible center marker:
   - Colored circle matching light color
   - White border for contrast
   - White center dot showing exact position
2. Click on light center marker → Light becomes selected
3. Selected light shows blue dashed selection ring
4. Click selected light again → Deselects
5. Selecting a light deselects any selected token
6. Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over lights

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### VTTSession Integration
- [x] Camera centering works from Active tab on tokens
- [x] Camera centering works from Active tab on lights
- [x] Light editor opens when clicking Edit on light
- [x] Camera centers on light when opening light editor
- [x] Token selection works from Active tab Edit button
- [ ] Test with multiple tokens/lights on different areas of map
- [ ] Test with zoomed in/out views

### Light Selectability
- [x] Light center markers visible on canvas
- [x] Lights are clickable (DM only)
- [x] Selection ring appears when light clicked
- [x] Clicking selected light deselects it
- [x] Selecting light deselects token
- [x] Cursor changes to pointer on hover
- [ ] Test with multiple lights close together
- [ ] Test with different light colors
- [ ] Test that players cannot select lights
- [ ] Test with flickering/animated lights

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Camera Centering Formula
```javascript
// Center viewport on point (x, y)
const newPos = {
  x: stage.width() / 2 - x * stageScale,
  y: stage.height() / 2 - y * stageScale
};
setStagePos(newPos);
```

### Light Selection State Flow
1. User clicks light center marker in LightingLayer
2. `handleLightClick(lightId)` called in LightingLayer
3. Event bubbled to MapCanvas via `onLightClick` prop
4. MapCanvas `handleLightClick` toggles `selectedLightId` state
5. LightingLayer receives new `selectedLightId` prop
6. Selection ring rendered around selected light

### Ref Callback Pattern
```javascript
// Parent (VTTSession)
const cameraCenterRef = useRef(null);

// Child (MapCanvas) exposes function
useEffect(() => {
  if (onCenterCamera && typeof onCenterCamera === 'function') {
    onCenterCamera.current = handleCenterCamera;
  }
}, [onCenterCamera, handleCenterCamera]);

// Usage in TokenManager
onCenterCamera={(x, y) => {
  if (cameraCenterRef.current) {
    cameraCenterRef.current(x, y);
  }
}}
```

## 🚀 Next: Phase 4 - Iterative Light Naming

**Goal**: Auto-name lights sequentially (Torch 1, Torch 2, Lantern 1, etc.)

**Plan**:
1. Create `generateLightName()` utility function
2. Update light creation flow in LightingPanel
3. Check existing lights of same type
4. Increment number for new light
5. Make names editable in LightingPanel

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## 💡 Key Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ TokenManager Active tab couldn't center camera
- ❌ Couldn't quickly navigate to tokens/lights on large maps
- ❌ Lights were not interactive
- ❌ No visual indication of light positions beyond glow effect

### After:
- ✅ Click Focus button to instantly center camera on any element
- ✅ Quick navigation on large maps with many elements
- ✅ Lights are now interactive and selectable (DM only)
- ✅ Clear visual markers show exact light positions
- ✅ Selection indicators make it obvious which light is selected

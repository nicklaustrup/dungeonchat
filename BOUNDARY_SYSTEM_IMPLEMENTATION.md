# Boundary System Implementation Plan

## ðŸ“Š Progress: 67% Complete (8/12 Phases) âœ…

**Status**: Core functionality + Polish complete - Production ready!  
**Next Step**: Phase 11 - Testing & Refinement  
**Quick Reference**: See `BOUNDARY_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`

---

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive boundary system for DMs to define movement restrictions on the VTT map. This includes:
1. **Line Boundaries** - Prevent crossing walls, cliffs, etc.
2. **Out of Bounds Areas** - Paint areas that are completely inaccessible (similar to Fog of War)

## Features

### Line Boundaries
- DMs can draw boundary lines that prevent token movement across them
- **Snap to Grid Mode**: Automatically align boundary lines to grid intersections
- **Free Place Mode**: Draw boundaries at any position for precise control
- Boundaries are only visible to DMs
- Used for walls, cliffs, fences, etc.

### Out of Bounds Areas (Paint)
- DMs can paint grid-based areas that tokens cannot enter
- **Brush-based painting**: Similar to Fog of War brush system
- **Brush size slider**: Control how many grid cells to paint at once
- Out of bounds areas render differently (e.g., red tint or diagonal lines)
- Grid-aligned for consistent boundaries

### UI Components
- **Boundaries Button**: Added to MapToolbar in DM-only section
- **BoundaryPanel**: Flyout panel with controls (similar to FogPanel)
  - Enable/Disable boundaries checkbox
  - View/Hide boundaries toggle (for DM visibility)
  - Line Bounds section with snap-to-grid checkbox
  - Paint Bounds section with brush size slider
  - Clear All button

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structure

#### Line Boundary
```javascript
{
  id: 'boundary_id',
  type: 'line',
  start: { x: number, y: number },
  end: { x: number, y: number },
  createdBy: 'user_id',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  visibleTo: 'dm',
  snappedToGrid: boolean
}
```

#### Painted Boundary (Out of Bounds Area)
```javascript
{
  id: 'boundary_id',
  type: 'painted',
  cells: [
    { gridX: number, gridY: number },
    { gridX: number, gridY: number },
    // ... more cells
  ],
  createdBy: 'user_id',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  visibleTo: 'dm'
}
```

#### Boundary State (Firestore Map Document)
```javascript
{
  boundaries: {
    enabled: boolean,
    visible: boolean, // DM can toggle visibility
    // Individual boundaries stored in subcollection
  }
}
```

### Service Methods

**boundaryService.js** enhancements needed:
- `createPaintedBoundary(firestore, campaignId, mapId, cells, createdBy)`
- `addPaintedCells(firestore, campaignId, mapId, boundaryId, cells)`
- `removePaintedCells(firestore, campaignId, mapId, boundaryId, cells)`
- `checkPointInBoundary(point, paintedBoundaries)`
- `getBoundaryState(firestore, campaignId, mapId)`
- `updateBoundaryState(firestore, campaignId, mapId, { enabled, visible })`

### Component Hierarchy
```
VTTSession
â””â”€â”€ MapCanvas
    â”œâ”€â”€ MapToolbar
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ BoundaryPanel (flyout)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Stage
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GridLayer
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BoundaryLayer (new)
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Line boundaries (Konva.Line)
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Painted boundaries (Konva.Rect with pattern)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TokenSprite
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Grid-aligned painting**: Out of bounds areas snap to grid cells for consistency and performance
2. **DM-only visibility**: Boundaries are invisible to players to maintain immersion
3. **Separate line and paint modes**: Different use cases require different interaction patterns
4. **Reuse Fog of War patterns**: Similar UI/UX to FogPanel for consistency
5. **Non-destructive**: Boundaries can be easily removed or disabled without affecting tokens
6. **Firestore subcollection**: Store boundaries in subcollection under map for better organization

## Visual Design

### Line Boundaries
- **Color**: Red/Orange (`#FF6B6B` or `#FF8C42`)
- **Style**: Dashed line, 2-3px thick
- **Opacity**: 60-70% when visible to DM
- **Hover**: Brighten on hover for selection

### Painted Boundaries
- **Color**: Red tint (`rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2)`)
- **Pattern**: Diagonal lines or crosshatch
- **Border**: Solid red border around painted cells
- **Opacity**: 30-40% to allow map visibility

### UI Panel (BoundaryPanel)
- Match FogPanel styling (purple border accent)
- Use boundary-themed colors (red/orange accents)
- Clear visual hierarchy for mode selection
- Slider for brush size with live preview

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Import boundaries from map images (wall detection AI)
- [ ] One-way boundaries (doors that only open one direction)
- [ ] Conditional boundaries (locked doors, breakable walls)
- [ ] Boundary templates (rooms, corridors)
- [ ] Copy/paste boundaries between maps
- [ ] Boundary groups (toggle entire sets on/off)
- [ ] Player-visible boundaries (force fields, visible walls)
- [ ] Height-based boundaries (flying tokens ignore)

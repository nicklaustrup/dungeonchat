# Campaign Settings Access Fixes - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Build Status**: ✅ Compiled successfully

---

## 🎯 Problems Fixed

### 1. ✅ Players Cannot Access Settings Tab (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Settings tab was hidden from players, preventing them from:
- Viewing campaign settings (read-only)
- Accessing "Leave Campaign" button
- Seeing campaign configuration

**Root Cause**: Settings tab button wrapped in `{isUserDM && (...)}` condition.

**Solution**: Removed DM-only wrapper from settings tab button.

**File Changed**: `CampaignDashboard.js`
- Line 233: Removed `{isUserDM &&` wrapper
- Settings tab now visible to all campaign members

---

### 2. ✅ Session Settings Not in Campaign Dashboard (HIGH)

**Problem**: Session-specific settings only accessible in VTT modal, not in Campaign Dashboard.

**Solution**: Integrated session settings directly into CampaignSettings form.

**Settings Added**:
1. **Progression System** (🎯)
   - XP (Experience Points) vs Milestone advancement
   - Select dropdown with help text

2. **Party Management Visibility** (👥)
   - 💰 Party Gold
   - 🎒 Character Inventory  
   - 📄 Character Sheets
   - Checkboxes with help text for each option

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Campaign Settings Structure
```
Campaign Settings
├── General Settings
│   ├── Campaign Name
│   ├── Description
│   ├── Game System
│   └── Campaign Header Photo
├── Privacy & Access
│   ├── Visibility
│   ├── Allow Requests
│   └── Maximum Members
├── Session Settings ← NEW SECTION
│   ├── Progression System
│   └── Party Management Visibility
└── Schedule
    ├── Session Frequency
    ├── Day of Week
    ├── Time
    └── Time Zone
```

### Data Model Updates
```javascript
// Added to campaign document
{
  // Session Settings
  progressionSystem: 'xp' | 'milestone',
  canViewGold: boolean,
  canViewInventory: boolean,
  canViewCharacterSheet: boolean
}
```

### Permission Logic
- **DM**: All fields editable, "Save Changes" button visible
- **Players**: All fields disabled/read-only, "Save Changes" button hidden
- **Both**: Can view all settings, access Leave Campaign (players) / Delete Campaign (DM) in Danger Zone

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### CampaignDashboard.js
**Change**: Removed DM-only conditional around settings tab
```javascript
// BEFORE
{isUserDM && (
  <button className={`nav-item ${activeTab === 'settings' ? 'active' : ''}`}>
    Settings
  </button>
)}

// AFTER
<button className={`nav-item ${activeTab === 'settings' ? 'active' : ''}`}>
  Settings
</button>
```

### CampaignSettings.js
**Changes**:
1. **Added session settings to formData state**:
   ```javascript
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
     // ... existing fields
     progressionSystem: 'xp',
     canViewGold: false,
     canViewInventory: false,
     canViewCharacterSheet: false
   });
   ```

2. **Updated loadCampaign to load session settings**:
   ```javascript
   setFormData({
     // ... existing fields
     progressionSystem: campaignData.progressionSystem || 'xp',
     canViewGold: campaignData.canViewGold ?? false,
     canViewInventory: campaignData.canViewInventory ?? false,
     canViewCharacterSheet: campaignData.canViewCharacterSheet ?? false
   });
   ```

3. **Added Session Settings UI**:
   - Section header: "Session Settings"
   - Description paragraph
   - Progression System section with select dropdown
   - Party Management section with 3 checkboxes
   - All fields respect `disabled={!isUserDM}` for read-only mode

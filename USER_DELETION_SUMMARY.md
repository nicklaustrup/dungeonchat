# User Account Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive user account deletion system that allows users to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data from the Superchat platform.

## Files Created

### 1. Cloud Function
**Location:** `functions/deleteUser.js`

A secure server-side Cloud Function that handles complete user data deletion:
- ✅ Authenticates user requests
- ✅ Deletes user profile and settings
- ✅ Removes username reservation
- ✅ Cleans up presence data (Realtime Database)
- ✅ Deletes all owned campaigns (complete removal)
- ✅ Removes user from joined campaigns
- ✅ Deletes all character sheets
- ✅ Removes user tokens from VTT maps
- ✅ Anonymizes messages (preserves conversation context)
- ✅ Updates campaign member counts
- ✅ Deletes user from Firebase Authentication

**Status:** ✅ Deployed to Firebase (us-central1)

### 2. Client Service
**Location:** `src/services/userDeletionService.js`

Provides client-side functionality:
- `deleteUserAccount()` - Calls cloud function
- `confirmAccountDeletion()` - Multi-step confirmation
- `useUserDeletion()` - React hook for account deletion

### 3. UI Component
**Location:** `src/components/Settings/DeleteAccountSection.js`

React component with:
- Danger zone UI with unlock mechanism
- Comprehensive warnings about deletion effects
- Multi-step confirmation process
- Loading and error states
- Automatic sign-out and redirect

### 4. Styles
**Location:** `src/components/Settings/DeleteAccountSection.css`

- Error handling
- Testing scenarios
- Compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Future enhancements

**Location:** `functions/README.md`

Updated functions documentation with:

### 6. Function Index
**Location:** `functions/index.js`

## Data Deletion Scope

### Permanently Deleted
- ✅ User profile (`userProfiles/{userId}`)
- ✅ Username reservation (`usernames/{username}`)
- ✅ Presence data (RTDB `presence/{userId}`)
- ✅ Owned campaigns (complete deletion with all subcollections)
- ✅ Campaign memberships (`campaigns/{campaignId}/members/{userId}`)
- ✅ Character sheets (`campaigns/{campaignId}/characters/{userId}`)
- ✅ User tokens (VTT)
- ✅ User campaigns tracking (`userCampaigns/{userId}`)
- ✅ Firebase Auth account

### Anonymized (Context Preserved)
- ✅ Messages → "[Deleted User]" (uid: "deleted_user")
- ✅ Campaign channel messages → "[Deleted User]"

## Security Features

✅ **Authentication Required**: Users can only delete their own accounts
✅ **Multi-step Confirmation**: 3 confirmation steps prevent accidental deletion
✅ **Username Verification**: Users must type their username to confirm
✅ **Server-side Execution**: All deletion runs with admin privileges
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
✅ **Atomic Operations**: Uses Firestore batches where possible

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Unlock Danger Zone" button
2. Views comprehensive warning about deletion effects
3. Clicks "Delete My Account" button
4. Types username to confirm
5. Provides final confirmation
6. Account and data deleted
7. User automatically signed out
8. Redirected to home page

## Integration Instructions

To add the Delete Account section to a settings page:

```jsx
import DeleteAccountSection from '../components/Settings/DeleteAccountSection';

function SettingsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="settings-page">
      {/* Other settings sections */}
      
      <DeleteAccountSection />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deployment Status

Access logs:
```bash
firebase functions:log --only deleteUser
```

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Cloud Function logs in Firebase Console
2. Review client-side error messages
3. Test in development environment first
4. Check [USER_DELETION.md](docs/USER_DELETION.md) for detailed docs

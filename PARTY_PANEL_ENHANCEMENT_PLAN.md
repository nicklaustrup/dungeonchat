## Technical Considerations

### Character Data Structure
Based on the existing code, characters have:
- `id`, `name`, `level`, `class`
- `race` (may need to add if missing)
- `currentHP`, `maxHP`, `armorClass`
- `experience`, `gold`
- `abilityScores` (object with str, dex, con, wis, int, cha)
- `avatarUrl` or similar (check database schema)

### Sidebar Width Management
- Current sidebar can be resized by user
- Need to ensure content adapts gracefully
- Use responsive grid/flex layouts
- Test with minimum and maximum sidebar widths

### State Management
- Selected character state at PartyManagement level
- Consider lifting state if needed for other features
- Ensure performance with real-time Firebase updates

### Styling Consistency
- Match existing VTT theme (dark mode support)
- Use existing CSS variables
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Smooth transitions for interactions

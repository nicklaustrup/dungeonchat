# Boundary System - Implementation Summary

## Completed Work (Phases 1-4)

### What Was Built

I've implemented the foundational boundary system for your VTT, completing 4 out of 12 phases (33%). The system now has:

1. **Enhanced Boundary Service** (`boundaryService.js`)
   - Support for line boundaries (walls, cliffs)
   - Support for painted boundaries (out of bounds areas)
   - Enable/disable and visibility controls
   - Collision detection algorithms
   - Full Firestore CRUD operations

2. **Boundary Panel UI Component** (`BoundaryPanel.jsx`)
   - Enable/Disable boundaries toggle
   - Show/Hide boundaries toggle (DM-only visibility)
   - Mode selection: Line or Paint
   - Line mode: Snap-to-grid checkbox
   - Paint mode: Brush size slider (1-10 cells) + Paint/Erase toggle
   - Clear All Boundaries button
   - Instructions and tooltips

3. **MapToolbar Integration**
   - New "Boundaries" button with Shield icon
   - Placed after Fog button in DM-only section
   - Panel flyout matching Fog panel style
   - Proper state management (closes other panels when opening)

4. **State Management**
   - Full state tree from VTTSession → MapCanvas → MapToolbar → BoundaryPanel
   - Real-time Firestore subscription for boundary state
   - All handlers properly wired up

## Current Status

✅ **UI is complete and functional**
- You can now see the Boundaries button in MapToolbar (DM only)
- Clicking it opens the BoundaryPanel flyout
- All controls are present and styled
- Panel matches the visual style of Fog panel with red/orange accents

❌ **Drawing functionality not yet implemented**
- Line drawing interaction (Phase 5)
- Paint brush interaction (Phase 6)
- Boundary rendering on canvas (Phase 9)
- Collision detection enforcement (Phase 7)

## Testing the UI

To test what's been built:
1. Start your app and join a VTT session as DM
2. Look for the Shield icon button in MapToolbar (after the Fog button)
3. Click it to open the Boundary Panel
4. Explore the controls:
   - Toggle boundaries on/off
   - Switch between Line and Paint modes
   - Adjust brush size slider
   - See the instructions

## Next Steps (Phases 5-12)

The remaining work includes:

**Phase 5: Line Boundary Drawing** 
- Add mouse interaction for drawing lines
- Snap to grid when enabled
- Preview while drawing
- Save to Firestore

**Phase 6: Paint Boundary Drawing**
- Add brush painting interaction
- Grid-aligned cell painting
- Erase mode
- Batch Firestore updates

**Phase 7: Collision Detection**
- Integrate boundary checking into token movement
- Prevent crossing line boundaries
- Prevent entering painted boundaries
- Visual feedback when blocked

**Phases 8-12: Polish & Testing**
- Boundary rendering layer
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Undo/redo support
- Performance optimization
- Testing and documentation

## File Changes Made

### New Files
1. `src/components/VTT/Canvas/BoundaryPanel.jsx` - Panel UI component
2. `src/components/VTT/Canvas/BoundaryPanel.css` - Panel styling
3. `BOUNDARY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full implementation plan

### Modified Files
1. `src/services/vtt/boundaryService.js` - Enhanced with painted boundaries
2. `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapToolbar.jsx` - Added Boundaries button & panel
3. `src/components/VTT/VTTSession/VTTSession.jsx` - Added boundary state & handlers
4. `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx` - Added boundary props

## Architecture

```
VTTSession (state management)
└── MapCanvas (prop passing)
    ├── MapToolbar (UI)
    │   └── BoundaryPanel (flyout)
    └── Stage (future: boundary rendering)
        └── BoundaryLayer (Phase 9)

Firestore Structure:
campaigns/{campaignId}/maps/{mapId}/
├── boundaries/{boundaryId}
│   ├── type: 'line' | 'painted'
│   ├── start/end (for lines)
│   ├── cells[] (for painted)
│   └── metadata
└── (map document)
    ├── boundariesEnabled: boolean
    └── boundariesVisible: boolean
```

## How to Continue

Refer to `BOUNDARY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for the complete plan. Each phase has a checklist of tasks. The next major milestone is implementing the drawing interactions (Phases 5-6), which will make the system actually functional for creating boundaries.

# Bug Fixes: Boundary System - Real-Time Collision Detection

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Map Dragging During Boundary Drawing ✅
**Issue**: When in Line or Paint mode, attempting to draw boundaries would also drag/move the map canvas, making it difficult to draw accurately.

**Root Cause**: The Stage component's `draggable` property was set to `activeTool === 'pointer' && !fogBrushActive`, which didn't account for boundary drawing modes.

**Fix**: Updated the draggable condition to also exclude boundary modes:
```javascript
draggable={activeTool === 'pointer' && !fogBrushActive && boundaryMode === null}
```

**Result**: Map canvas is now locked when drawing boundaries, preventing accidental map movement.

### Bug 2: Visual Feedback Only on Drop ✅
**Issue**: The red collision feedback only appeared when a token was dropped in an invalid location. There was no visual indication during the drag operation that the player was hovering over a boundary or out-of-bounds area.

**Root Cause**: Collision detection only ran in `handleTokenDragEnd`, not during the drag operation itself.

**Fix**: 
1. Added `boundaries` prop to TokenSprite component
2. Added `isOverBoundary` state to track real-time collision status
3. Implemented `checkBoundaryCollision()` helper function in TokenSprite
4. Added collision checking in `handleDragMove()` to update state during drag
5. Updated visual rendering to show red border when `isOverBoundary` is true

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// In handleDragMove - real-time collision detection
if (dragStartPos) {
  const currentPos = { x: rawX, y: rawY };
  const colliding = checkBoundaryCollision(dragStartPos, currentPos);
  setIsOverBoundary(colliding);
}

// Visual feedback
<Circle
  strokeWidth={(boundaryCollision || isOverBoundary) ? 4 : (isSelected ? 1.5 : 1)}
  stroke={(boundaryCollision || isOverBoundary) ? '#FF0000' : (isSelected ? '#fff' : '#000')}
  shadowColor={(boundaryCollision || isOverBoundary) ? '#FF0000' : undefined}
  shadowBlur={(boundaryCollision || isOverBoundary) ? 15 : undefined}
/>
```

**Result**: Token now shows red border and glow **during drag** when hovering over boundaries or out-of-bounds areas.

---

### Bug 3: Token Placement in Invalid Locations ✅
**Issue**: Tokens could be placed in out-of-bounds areas or across boundaries. While they would snap back after placement, this was confusing and felt like a bug.

**Root Cause**: The `handleDragEnd` in TokenSprite only checked map boundaries, not custom boundaries. Even when it detected an issue, it would still call `onDragEnd`, allowing the position to potentially be saved.

**Fix**:
1. Added boundary collision check in `handleDragEnd`
2. If boundary collision or map boundary violation detected, token snaps to `dragStartPos`
3. The corrected position is passed to `onDragEnd`, ensuring Firestore receives valid position

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
const handleDragEnd = (e) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Check for boundary collision
  const crossesBoundary = dragStartPos && checkBoundaryCollision(dragStartPos, { x, y });

  if ((isOffLimits || crossesBoundary) && dragStartPos) {
    // Reset to ghost position if dropped in off-limits area or crosses boundary
    x = dragStartPos.x;
    y = dragStartPos.y;
    node.x(x);
    node.y(y);
  }
  
  // ... rest of snapping logic ...
  
  // Clear boundary state
  setIsOverBoundary(false);
}
```

**Result**: Tokens can no longer be placed in invalid locations. They automatically snap back to their starting position if dropped on a boundary.

  - ✅ Map should NOT move
  - ✅ Cells should paint cleanly

  - ✅ Token should remain normal color
- [x] Create painted boundary
- [x] Drag token toward painted area
  - ✅ Token should turn red when hovering over painted cells
  - ✅ Token should return to normal when moved away

### Test Bug Fix 3: Prevent Invalid Placement
- [x] Create a line boundary
- [x] Try to drag token across boundary and release
  - ✅ Token should snap back to starting position
  - ✅ Token should NOT stay at invalid location
  - ✅ Position should NOT be saved to Firestore
- [x] Create painted boundary
- [x] Try to drop token on painted cell
  - ✅ Token should snap back to starting position
  - ✅ No invalid position saved
- [x] Drop token in valid location
  - ✅ Token should stay at new position
  - ✅ Position should be saved normally

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Collision Detection Algorithm (TokenSprite)

```javascript
const checkBoundaryCollision = (from, to) => {
  if (!boundaries || boundaries.length === 0) return false;

  for (const boundary of boundaries) {
    if (boundary.type === 'line') {
      // Line-line intersection
      if (linesIntersect(
        from.x, from.y, to.x, to.y,
        boundary.start.x, boundary.start.y, boundary.end.x, boundary.end.y
      )) {
        return true;
      }
    } else if (boundary.type === 'painted') {
      // Point-in-cell check
      const gridX = Math.floor((to.x - gridOffsetX) / gridSize);
      const gridY = Math.floor((to.y - gridOffsetY) / gridSize);
      
      if (boundary.cells && boundary.cells.some(cell => 
        cell.gridX === gridX && cell.gridY === gridY
      )) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

### Real-Time Feedback Flow

```
Token Drag Start
    ↓
Store dragStartPos
    ↓
    [During Drag]
    ↓
handleDragMove fires continuously
    ↓
Check collision: dragStartPos → currentPos
    ↓
    ├─ Collision? → setIsOverBoundary(true) → Red visual
    └─ No Collision? → setIsOverBoundary(false) → Normal
    ↓
    [On Drop]
    ↓
handleDragEnd fires
    ↓
Final collision check
    ↓
    ├─ Valid? → Save position
    └─ Invalid? → Snap back to dragStartPos
    ↓
Clear isOverBoundary state
```

## 🎨 Visual Feedback States

### Normal Token (Not Dragging)
- Border: 1px black (or 1.5px white if selected)
- No shadow
- Normal opacity

### Dragging Over Valid Area
- Border: 1px black (or 1.5px white if selected)
- No shadow
- Normal opacity
- Ruler line shows from start position

### Dragging Over Boundary (NEW!)
- Border: **4px red**
- Shadow: **Red glow, 15px blur, 80% opacity**
- This happens **during drag**, not just on drop

### After Invalid Drop Attempt (300ms flash)
- Border: **4px red**
- Shadow: **Red glow**
- Token snaps back to starting position
- Effect clears after 300ms

## 🚀 Performance Impact

### Before Fixes
- Collision detection: Only on drop (1 check per drag operation)
- CPU cost: Minimal

### After Fixes
- Collision detection: On every mouse move during drag
- CPU cost: Slightly higher, but negligible
- Optimization: Early return if no boundaries present
- Typical scenario: ~10-30 checks per drag operation

**Performance Note**: The collision detection algorithm is O(n) where n = number of boundaries. For typical maps with 5-20 boundaries, this is imperceptible. If performance becomes an issue with 100+ boundaries, spatial partitioning can be added later.

## 🎮 User Experience Improvements

### Before Fixes
1. **Confusing Interaction**: Map would move unexpectedly when trying to draw
2. **No Visual Guidance**: Players didn't know they were about to make an invalid move
3. **Post-Facto Correction**: Tokens would appear to accept placement, then snap back

### After Fixes
1. **Clean Drawing**: Map stays still, boundaries draw cleanly
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Red glow appears as soon as token hovers over invalid area
3. **Prevented Placement**: Invalid moves are blocked entirely, not corrected after the fact

**Result**: Much more polished, professional feel. Players understand the restrictions intuitively.

## ✅ All Bugs Fixed!

All three bugs have been resolved:
- ✅ Map no longer moves during boundary drawing
- ✅ Real-time visual feedback during token drag
- ✅ Invalid placements prevented entirely

The boundary system now provides **excellent UX** with clear, immediate feedback about movement restrictions.

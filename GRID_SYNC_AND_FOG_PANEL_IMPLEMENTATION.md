# VTT Grid Sync and Fog Panel Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the grid sync issue and implement the fog of war panel system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Grid Enable/Disable Not Syncing to Players
**Problem**: When the DM enabled or disabled the grid, players didn't see the change until refreshing the page.

**Root Cause**: The VTTSession component was only loading the active map once when `activeMapId` changed in the campaign document. Subsequent changes to the map document (like `gridEnabled`) weren't being listened to.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `VTTSession.jsx` to subscribe directly to the active map document using Firestore's `onSnapshot`
- Now when the DM changes `gridEnabled` (or any other map property), all users receive the update in real-time
- Changes in `VTTSession.jsx` lines ~120-180

### 2. Fog Button Opens Panel Instead of Toggling State
**Problem**: The Fog button directly toggled fog on/off, making it difficult to access brush controls and other fog management features.

**Solution**:
- Created new `FogPanel` component (`FogPanel.jsx` and `FogPanel.css`)
- Panel includes:
  - Enable/Disable checkbox for fog
  - Brush mode selector (Reveal/Conceal)
  - Brush size slider (1-10 cells)
  - Quick action buttons (Reveal All / Conceal All)
  - Instructions for usage
- Updated fog button to open the panel instead of toggling fog
- Panel positioned at `top: 60px, left: 520px` to align with other canvas controls

### 3. Token Manager Button Moved to Canvas Controls
**Problem**: Token Manager button was in the top toolbar, disconnected from other canvas-specific controls.

**Solution**:
- Removed Token Manager button from `VTTSession` toolbar
- Added Token Manager button to the `canvas-controls-top` div in `MapCanvas`
- Button positioned alongside other DM canvas controls (Layers, Maps, Encounters, Player View, Fog, FX Library)
- Button shows active state (purple background) when token manager is open

## Files Created

1. **`src/components/VTT/Canvas/FogPanel.jsx`**
   - New component for fog of war controls
   - Includes brush size, mode, and quick actions

2. **`src/components/VTT/Canvas/FogPanel.css`**
   - Styling for the fog panel
   - Purple gradient header to match theme
   - Responsive controls with hover effects

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/VTT/VTTSession/VTTSession.jsx`
- Added fog panel state: `showFogPanel`, `fogBrushSize`, `fogBrushMode`
- Modified campaign listener to subscribe to active map changes in real-time
- Replaced `handleToggleFog` with multiple handlers:
  - `handleOpenFogPanel` - Opens the fog panel
  - `handleToggleFogEnabled` - Enables/disables fog
  - `handleRevealAll` - Reveals entire map
  - `handleConcealAll` - Conceals entire map
- Removed Token Manager button from toolbar
- Updated `MapCanvas` props to pass fog panel controls and token manager toggle

### 2. `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx`
- Added new props for fog panel controls:
  - `showFogPanel`, `onOpenFogPanel`, `onCloseFogPanel`
  - `onToggleFogEnabled`, `onRevealAll`, `onConcealAll`
  - `fogBrushSize`, `onFogBrushSizeChange`
  - `fogBrushMode`, `onFogBrushModeChange`
  - `showTokenManager`, `onToggleTokenManager`
- Added `FogPanel` import
- Changed fog button to open panel instead of toggling fog state
- Added Token Manager button to `canvas-controls-top` div
- Rendered `FogPanel` component with all necessary props

### 3. `src/services/vtt/fogOfWarService.js`
- Updated `updateFogOfWar` method signature to accept optional `enabled` parameter
- Method now accepts:
  - `visibility` (optional) - 2D array of visibility state
  - `enabled` (optional) - Boolean to enable/disable fog
- Added alias methods:
  - `clearFogOfWar` - Alias for `clearAllFog`
  - `resetFogOfWar` - Alias for `resetAllFog`
- Ensures backward compatibility while supporting new functionality

## Technical Details

### Real-time Map Sync
The campaign listener now maintains two subscriptions:
1. **Campaign subscription**: Listens for `activeMapId` changes
2. **Map subscription**: Listens for changes to the active map document

When the active map changes:
- Old map subscription is cleaned up
- New map subscription is established
- All map property changes sync in real-time to all users

### Fog Panel Architecture
The fog panel uses controlled components:
- State managed in `VTTSession`
- Props passed down through `MapCanvas`
- Panel only renders when `open={true}`
- All actions trigger callbacks to parent components
- Changes sync via `fogOfWarService` to Firestore

### Button Organization
Canvas controls are now organized by function:
```
[Layers] [Maps] [Encounters] [Player View] [Fog] [Tokens] [FX Library ▼]
                                                   └─ New location
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Grid enable/disable syncs to all users immediately
- [x] Fog button opens panel instead of toggling fog
- [x] Fog panel has enable/disable checkbox
- [x] Fog panel has brush size slider (1-10 cells)

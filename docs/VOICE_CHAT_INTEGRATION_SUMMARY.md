## How It Works

### Component Reuse
The same `VoiceChatPanel` component powers all three locations:
1. `/voice-demo` - Testing/demo page
2. Campaign Dashboard - Dedicated tab
3. Campaign Chat - Floating overlay

### Voice Room
- All locations use the same voice room: `voice-general`
- Campaign members can join from anywhere
- Only one active connection per user

---

## User Experience

### Dashboard Flow
```
Campaign → Voice Chat Tab → Join Voice → Connected
```

### Chat Flow  
```
Campaign Chat → Voice Button → Floating Panel → Join Voice → Chat + Talk!
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test Dashboard Integration
1. Navigate to any campaign dashboard
2. Look for "🎙️ Voice Chat" in the sidebar
3. Click it - voice panel should load
4. Click "Join Voice" - should connect
5. Switch to other tabs - voice should stay connected

### Test Chat Integration
1. Navigate to campaign chat (`/campaign/:id/chat`)
2. Look for "🎙️ Voice" button (top-right, next to member count)
3. Click it - floating panel should appear (bottom-right)

5. Type messages while in voice - both should work
6. Click X or Voice button to close panel

### Test Two Users

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Start Phase 3.2**: Begin gradual rollout
2. **Copy environment config**: Use `deployment-configs/.env.production-gradual`
3. **Enable monitoring**: Run `node scripts/monitor-migration.js` regularly
4. **Watch console logs**: Monitor A/B comparison data

### Environment Configurations Created:
- `deployment-configs/.env.development` - Development - A/B comparison active for testing
- `deployment-configs/.env.staging` - Staging - A/B comparison active for validation
- `deployment-configs/.env.production-gradual` - Production - Gradual rollout with monitoring
- `deployment-configs/.env.production-full` - Production - Full V2 deployment
- `deployment-configs/.env.production-rollback` - Production - Emergency rollback to V1

### Monitoring Tools:
- **Health Check**: `node scripts/monitor-migration.js`
- **Emergency Rollback**: `node scripts/emergency-rollback.js "reason"`

### Deployment Timeline:
- üîÑ **Phase 3.1**: Migration Planning (Immediate)

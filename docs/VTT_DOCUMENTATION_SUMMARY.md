## 🎯 How Your Feedback Shaped the Docs

### Your Input: "Solid MVP would be..."
**Result:** Created VTT_MVP_SCOPE.md with clear MVP vs stretch goals vs post-MVP

**MVP Features (Must Have):**
- ✅ Map upload + adjustable grid
- ✅ Player & enemy tokens
- ✅ Basic pinging

**Stretch Goals:**
- 🎯 Live cursor tracking (you mentioned this specifically)

**Post-MVP:**
- ❌ Fog of War, drawing tools, etc. (clearly deferred)

---

### Your Input: "Basic DM view map editor..."
**Result:** Prioritized Phase 1 & 2 in MVP Scope

**Phase 1-2 Focus:**
1. Map upload and grid configuration
2. Token placement and management
3. Save to library for future sessions

**This becomes functional before** real-time player view (Phase 3)

---

### Your Input: "What other libraries... tradeoffs..."
**Result:** Created VTT_TECH_STACK_COMPARISON.md

**Detailed Comparison:**
- 5 canvas libraries analyzed
- Pros/cons for each
- Comparison matrix
- Bundle size impact
- Performance benchmarks
- Code examples for each

**Key Tradeoffs Explained:**
- Konva.js: Best React integration, perfect for VTT, ~400KB
- Fabric.js: Advanced vector graphics, steeper curve, ~400KB
- PixiJS: Best performance, overkill for VTT, lower-level API
- Plain Canvas: No dependencies, too much manual work
- Three.js: 3D capabilities, massive overkill, ~600KB

**Recommendation:** Konva.js (with detailed reasoning)

---

### Your Input: "I will work on UI mockups"
**Result:** Provided detailed layout descriptions and component structure

**In Quick Start Guide:**
- Component checklist with all needed components
- Code snippets showing structure
- Directory organization

**In Strategy Doc:**
- Layout diagrams (ASCII art)
- UI component descriptions
- Toolbar and panel specifications

**This gives you structure to design against** 🎨

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Scope Decisions:
✅ **MVP:** Map + grid + tokens + pinging (6 weeks)
✅ **Stretch:** Live cursors, player movement, snap-to-grid
❌ **Post-MVP:** Fog of war, drawing, measurements (future)

### Technical Decisions:
✅ **Canvas Library:** Konva.js (best React integration)
✅ **File Upload:** react-dropzone (great UX)
✅ **Color Picker:** react-colorful (small bundle)
✅ **Sync Strategy:** Firestore for persistent, RTDB for cursors (stretch)

### Architecture Decisions:
✅ **DM-First:** Build editor before player view
✅ **Phase-Based:** 4 phases over 6 weeks
✅ **Service Layer:** Separate services for map, token, ping
✅ **Context Integration:** Extend CampaignContext for map state

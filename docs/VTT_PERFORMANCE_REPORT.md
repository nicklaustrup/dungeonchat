---
## Phase Overview
| Phase | Goal | Core Outcomes |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Restructure layers & isolate high-frequency updates | Reduced full-layer redraws, stable FPS during drags/animations |
| 2 | Replace React-driven transient animation state with imperative refs | Near-elimination of unnecessary React renders per frame |
| 3 | Memoize + stabilize component/handler identities | Minimal diffing for static nodes (tokens, shapes) |
| 4 | Apply node / group caching & rasterization | Fewer vector recalculations; lower CPU/GPU cost |
| 5 | Optimize data flows (Firestore batching, fog, lights) | Lower network + compute churn |
| 6 | Optional advanced enhancements | Progressive quality + scalability improvements |

---
## Phase 1 â€“ Layer Architecture (P1)
Goal: Separate static vs. dynamic drawing surfaces; remove cross-contamination of redraw triggers.

| ID | Task | File / Scope | Action Steps | Verification |
|----|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1.1 | Split Background from Dynamic Highlight | `MapCanvas.jsx` (Stage layers) | 1. Create `BackgroundLayer` (map image only). 2. Move token snap highlight `<Rect>` into new `SnapFeedbackLayer` above it. 3. Optionally use `FastLayer` for highlight. | âœ… Implemented: `BackgroundLayer.jsx` & `SnapFeedbackLayer.jsx`; background no longer rerenders during token drag. |
| 1.2 | Decompose Monolithic Effects Layer | `MapCanvas.jsx` current combined shapes/drawings/pings/ruler/etc. | Create explicit layers: `ShapesLayer`, `DrawingsLayer`, `MeasurementLayer`, `PingLayer`, (light previews kept inline). | âœ… Implemented new layer components; removed monolithic block. |
| 1.3 | Isolate Fog Rendering | Player + DM fog block loops | Wrap fog into `FogLayer` components receiving immutable props; mark `listening={false}`. | âœ… `FogLayer.jsx` created; both player & DM fog paths use it. |
| 1.4 | Introduce Optional Fog Raster Path | New `FogRasterizer` helper | When fog cell count > threshold (e.g. 4k), pre-render to offscreen `<canvas>` â†’ pass to `<Konva.Image>`. | âœ… Implemented inside `FogLayer.jsx` (prop `rasterThreshold`, default 4000). Uses offscreen canvas keyed by visibility hash; falls back to vector for smaller grids. |
| 1.5 | Token Layer Extraction | Token rendering block | Move token mapping into `TokenLayer` component (memoized). | âœ… `TokenLayer.jsx` implemented; token & light control logic moved. |

---
## Phase 2 â€“ Imperative Interaction & Animation (P1)
Goal: Remove per-frame React state churn for live tools (pen, ruler, pings, shape preview, snap pulse).

| ID | Task | Scope | Action Steps | Verification |
|----|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 2.1 | Pen Tool Ref Migration | `MapCanvas.jsx` pen logic | Replaced transient state with refs (`penPointsRef`, `penLiveLineRef`) + layer `batchDraw()`. Persist only on mouseup. | âœ… Live stroke no React churn per point. |
| 2.2 | Ruler Live Update via Refs | Ruler logic | Start remains in state; end tracked via `rulerEndRef` + `rulerTempLineRef` imperatively. | âœ… Pointer move doesn't trigger React re-render. |
| 2.3 | Shape Preview Imperative | Shape creation flow | Imperative geometry updates via `shapePreviewRef` (circle/rect/line/cone) and `batchDraw()`. | âœ… Preview updates each frame without state updates. |
| 2.4 | Ping Animation Refactor | Pings fade logic | Replace interval + state spread with rAF loop iterating ping nodes in `PingLayer`. Update alpha; call `batchDraw()`. | âœ… Implemented rAF in `PingLayer.jsx` (imperative node mutation, no React churn). |
| 2.5 | Snap Highlight Pulse Refactor | Snap highlight | Pulse handled inside `SnapFeedbackLayer` rAF; removed `tokenSnapPulse` state. | âœ… No React renders during pulse. |
| 2.6 | Light Drag Preview | Light dragging | Use refs for preview circles; update positions w/out React state except final commit. | âœ… Implemented via `LightInteractionLayer` + imperative API (`show/move/hide`). |

---
## Phase 3 â€“ Memoization & Stable Identities (P2)
Goal: Prevent avoidable reconciliation / diffing.

| ID | Task | Scope | Action Steps | Verification |
|----|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 3.1 | Memoize Handlers | All Stage & token handlers | Wrap stage handlers (`handleWheel` etc.) in `useCallback`. Hoist per-token handlers. | âœ… Core stage handlers wrapped (`handleWheel/DragEnd/StageClick/MouseDown/Move`). |
| 3.2 | `TokenSprite` Memoization | `TokenSprite.jsx` | Wrap with `React.memo` + custom equality comparing position, hp, status length, selection. | âœ… Implemented `areEqual` custom comparator. |
| 3.3 | Stage Style Memoization | `MapCanvas.jsx` | Memoize `style` object. | âœ… `stageStyle` useMemo added. |
| 3.4 | Derived Fog Cells Hash | `FogLayer` | Compute `fogVersion` (hash of visibility array) â€“ only rebuild cells when hash changes. | âœ… `fogVersionKey` already implemented; confirms Phase 3 requirement. |
| 3.5 | Memoize Lights Array | Lights merge operation | `useMemo([...lights, ...playerTokenLights].filter(...))`. | âœ… `mergedLights` useMemo added. |

---
## Phase 4 â€“ Konva Node / Group Caching (P3)
Goal: Cache expensive composite nodes.

| ID | Task | Scope | Action Steps | Verification |
|----|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 4.1 | Token Group Cache | `TokenSprite` Group | After mount or changes (image, hp, status), call `groupRef.current.cache({ pixelRatio:1 })`. | âœ… Implemented (`groupRef` + effect, skips during drag). |
| 4.2 | Static Shapes Cache | Non-animated shapes | Cache each after first render. Only update opacity. | âœ… Persistent shapes grouped & cached; ephemeral (fading) shapes excluded. |
| 4.3 | Pinned Ruler Cache | Pinned measurement UI | Cache the measurement group post-creation. | âœ… Pinned rulers grouped & cached (dynamic active ruler uncached). |
| 4.4 | Grid Cache | `GridLayer` | Cache entire layer after build. Invalidate on grid change. | âœ… `Group` + `cache()` after lines generation. |
| 4.5 | Optional Light Gradient Cache | Lighting | Pre-render gradient to offscreen canvas if flicker disabled. | âœ… Static non-flicker lights cached to images (`mask` + `glow`); dynamic lights still live. |

---
## Phase 5 â€“ Data & Network Flow Optimizations (P1/P2 Mixed)
Goal: Reduce backend & CPU churn.

| ID | Task | Scope | Action Steps | Verification |
|----|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 5.1 | Fog Reveal Batching | Fog reveal loops | Accumulate changed indices; send single update. | âœ… Batching via `queueRevealCell` + timed flush (250ms). |
| 5.2 | Light Reveal Diffing | Light-driven fog | Track prior reveal radius cells; only send delta. | âœ… `lightRevealChanged` skips unchanged light centers. |
| 5.3 | Debounce Shape Preview Broadcast | Shape preview updates | Throttle broadcast to e.g. 30Hz using `requestAnimationFrame` guard. | âœ… Implemented rAF + min-interval scheduler (~30Hz) in `MapCanvas.jsx` (Phase 5.3). |
| 5.4 | Token Move Persistence Guard | Token drag | Ensure no mid-drag writes slip in (audit code paths). | âœ… Only drag-end queues reveal; no mid-drag writes. |
| 5.5 | Lazy Load High-Res Map | Background image | Load low-res first, swap once high-res complete. | âœ… Progressive lowâ†’high cross-fade (250ms) in `BackgroundLayer.jsx`; faster first paint. |

---
## Phase 6 â€“ Advanced / Optional Enhancements
| ID | Task | Description | Verification |
|----|------|-------------|--------------|
| 6.1 | Multi-Resolution Background | Provide mip levels & swap by zoom | âœ… Implemented basic 0.5x / 0.25x variants & selection by `stageScale` in `BackgroundLayer.jsx`. |
| 6.2 | Light Mask Composition | Single blended mask per frame | âœ… Composite mask + glow canvases (one `KonvaImage` pair) in `LightingLayer.jsx`. |
| 6.3 | Performance Overlay | FPS + render counts overlay | âœ… `PerformanceOverlay.jsx` with FPS/ms/draw counters + toggle. |
| 6.4 | Interaction FSM | Replace scattered tool conditionals | Code complexity & bug density reduced (review). |
| 6.5 | Offscreen Worker Raster | Fog & lighting precompute in Web Worker | âœ… Fog raster offloaded (worker: `vttRasterWorkerFactory.js`); lighting static path available for extension. |

---

## Rollback / Risk Notes
| Change Type | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------|------|------------|
| Imperative refs | Drift from React state | Keep authoritative commit step; guard null refs |
| Raster fog | Visual parity issues | Feature flag + checksum compare of cell counts |
| Layer splitting | Z-order regressions | Write explicit ordering test notes / visual QA list |
| Caching | Stale visuals after prop change | Invalidate cache in `useEffect` on dependency change |

---
## Post-Implementation Validation Script (Human-Friendly)
1. Start app; load a large map (â‰¥ 3000x3000 px, dense fog).
2. Drag a single medium token for 5 seconds while DevTools Performance recording.
3. Confirm:
   - React render count for other tokens stays constant.
   - Only dynamic layers log draws (if logging enabled).
   - FPS â‰¥ target range.
4. Draw a continuous pen stroke for 4 seconds:
   - No React state spam in console.
   - Stroke remains smooth.
5. Activate ruler and move pointer rapidly:
   - Distance updates visually each frame; React renders minimal.
6. Trigger 3 simultaneous pings:
   - Pings animate; CPU not spiking; no map image redraw.
7. Toggle fog visibility & ensure raster / vector parity (optional A/B diff snapshot).
8. Move a light source with flicker on:
   - Light updates smoothly; only lighting layer redraws.
9. Check Network panel for token drag: only final position write.
10. Record final metrics table vs. baseline.

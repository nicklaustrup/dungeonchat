# Campaign System Strategy Document

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic approach for implementing a campaign-based chat system for DungeonChat, transforming it from a single general chat room into a multi-campaign D&D platform where users can create and join specific campaign instances, each with their own isolated chat channels.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Single Chat Room**: All users currently join a shared global chat room
- **Firebase Stack**: Firestore (messages), RTDB (presence/typing), Auth (Google OAuth), Storage (images)
- **Data Collections**:
  - `messages` - Global message collection
  - `userProfiles` - User profile data
  - `usernames` - Username availability tracking
  - `presence` - User presence data
- **Key Components**: `ChatPage`, `ChatRoom`, `ChatInput`, `ChatHeader`
- **State Management**: Context-based with `ChatStateContext`

### Current User Flow
1. User signs in with Google OAuth
2. Automatically joined to the general chat room
3. Can send messages, reactions, replies, images
4. Real-time presence and typing indicators

## Strategic Vision

### Goal
Transform DungeonChat into a campaign-centric platform where:
- Users can create D&D campaigns (as Dungeon Masters)
- Players can discover and join campaigns
- Each campaign has isolated chat channels
- General lobby exists for campaign discovery and general discussion
- Rich campaign metadata supports D&D-specific features

### Core Principles
1. **Preserve Current UX**: Existing chat functionality remains intact within campaign contexts
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add campaign features without breaking existing user flows
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Design for future D&D-specific features (character sheets, dice rolling, etc.)
4. **Social Discovery**: Enable players to find campaigns and DMs to find players

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Model

### 1.1 Data Architecture

#### New Collections

```javascript
// campaigns/{campaignId}
{
  id: 'auto-generated',
  name: 'The Lost Mines of Phandelver',
  description: 'A classic D&D 5e adventure for new players...',
  dmId: 'user123', // Dungeon Master's uid
  maxPlayers: 6,
  currentPlayers: 3,
  visibility: 'public', // 'public', 'private', 'invite-only'
  gameSystem: 'D&D 5e', // 'D&D 5e', 'Pathfinder', 'Custom', etc.
  campaignImage: 'https://storage.../campaign-image.jpg',
  settings: {
    allowSpectators: false,
    requireApproval: true,
    allowPlayerInvites: false
  },
  status: 'recruiting', // 'recruiting', 'active', 'completed', 'paused'
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  lastActivity: Timestamp,
  tags: ['beginner-friendly', 'roleplay-heavy', 'weekly']
}

// campaigns/{campaignId}/members/{userId}
{
  userId: 'user456',
  role: 'player', // 'dm', 'player', 'spectator'
  status: 'active', // 'pending', 'active', 'invited', 'banned'
  joinedAt: Timestamp,
  lastActive: Timestamp,
  characterName: 'Thorin Ironforge', // Optional
  characterClass: 'Fighter', // Optional
  notes: 'Prefers evening sessions' // DM notes
}

// campaigns/{campaignId}/channels/{channelId}
{
  id: 'general', // 'general', 'character-discussion', 'ooc', custom names
  name: 'General Chat',
  description: 'Main campaign discussion',
  type: 'text', // Future: 'voice', 'dice-rolling'
  visibility: 'all', // 'all', 'players-only', 'dm-only'
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  createdBy: 'user123'
}

// campaigns/{campaignId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}
{
  // Extends existing message schema
  text: 'Rolling for initiative!',
  uid: 'user456',
  displayName: 'Alice',
  campaignId: 'campaign123',
  channelId: 'general',
  // ... existing message fields (reactions, replies, etc.)
}

// userCampaigns/{userId}
{
  activeCampaigns: ['campaign1', 'campaign2'],
  dmCampaigns: ['campaign3'],
  favoriteCampaigns: ['campaign4'],
  lastViewedCampaign: 'campaign1',
  campaignInvites: ['campaign5']
}
```

#### Modified Collections

```javascript
// userProfiles/{userId} - Extend existing
{
  // ... existing fields
  campaignPreferences: {
    gameSystems: ['D&D 5e', 'Pathfinder'],
    playerType: 'social', // 'tactical', 'social', 'exploration', 'mixed'
    availability: 'evenings-weekends',
    experienceLevel: 'beginner'
  },
  dmProfile: {
    isDM: false,
    dmRating: 4.5,
    campaignsRun: 3,
    dmStyle: 'story-focused' // 'story-focused', 'tactical', 'sandbox'
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Firebase Security Rules Extension

```javascript
// Add to existing firestore.rules
match /campaigns/{campaignId} {
  // Anyone can read public campaigns
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource.data.visibility == 'public' || 
     exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)/members/$(request.auth.uid)));
  
  // Only DM can create/update campaign
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.dmId;
  allow update: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.dmId;
    
  match /members/{userId} {
    allow read: if request.auth != null;
    allow write: if request.auth != null && 
      (request.auth.uid == userId || 
       request.auth.uid == get(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)).data.dmId);
  }
  
  match /channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId} {
    allow read: if request.auth != null && 
      exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)/members/$(request.auth.uid));
    allow create: if request.auth != null && 
      request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid &&
      exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)/members/$(request.auth.uid));
  }
}

match /userCampaigns/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### 1.3 URL Routing Strategy

```
Current: /chat
Proposed:
- / (landing/campaign discovery)
- /lobby (general chat - existing functionality)
- /campaigns (campaign browser)
- /campaign/{campaignId} (campaign dashboard)
- /campaign/{campaignId}/chat (campaign chat - reuses existing ChatPage)
- /campaign/{campaignId}/chat/{channelId} (specific channel)
- /create-campaign (campaign creation)
- /profile (user profile with campaign preferences)
```

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

### 2.1 Campaign Management Components

#### New Components Needed

```javascript
// src/components/Campaign/
├── CampaignBrowser.js         // Browse/search campaigns
├── CampaignCard.js            // Campaign preview card
├── CampaignDashboard.js       // Campaign overview page
├── CampaignCreator.js         // Create new campaign form

function ChatPage({ campaignId, channelId }) {
  // Add campaign context
  // Modify message queries to filter by campaign/channel
  // Update presence tracking to be campaign-scoped
}

// src/hooks/useChatMessages.js - Extend for campaigns
export function useChatMessages({ 
  firestore, 
  campaignId = null, 
  channelId = 'general',
  limitBatchSize = 25, 
  maxLimit = 1000 
}) {
  // Modify collection reference based on campaign context
  const messagesRef = React.useMemo(() => {
    if (!firestore) return null;
    
    if (campaignId) {
      // Campaign-specific messages
      return collection(firestore, 'campaigns', campaignId, 'channels', channelId, 'messages');
    } else {
      // Global lobby messages (existing)
      return collection(firestore, 'messages');
    }
  }, [firestore, campaignId, channelId]);
  
  // Rest of implementation remains the same
}
```

### 2.2 State Management Extension

```javascript
// src/contexts/CampaignContext.js - New context
export const CampaignContext = createContext(null);

export function CampaignProvider({ children }) {
  const [currentCampaign, setCurrentCampaign] = useState(null);
  const [userCampaigns, setUserCampaigns] = useState([]);
  const [currentChannel, setCurrentChannel] = useState('general');
  
  // Campaign-related actions
  const joinCampaign = useCallback(async (campaignId) => { /* ... */ }, []);
  const leaveCampaign = useCallback(async (campaignId) => { /* ... */ }, []);
  const switchCampaign = useCallback((campaignId) => { /* ... */ }, []);
  const switchChannel = useCallback((channelId) => { /* ... */ }, []);
  
  return (
    <CampaignContext.Provider value={{
      currentCampaign,
      userCampaigns,
      currentChannel,
      joinCampaign,
      leaveCampaign,
      switchCampaign,
      switchChannel
    }}>
      {children}
    </CampaignContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useCampaign = () => useContext(CampaignContext);
```

### 2.3 Service Layer Extensions

```javascript
// src/services/campaignService.js - New service
export async function createCampaign(firestore, campaignData, dmId) {
  const campaignRef = await addDoc(collection(firestore, 'campaigns'), {
    ...campaignData,
    dmId,
    currentPlayers: 1,
    createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
    updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
    lastActivity: serverTimestamp()
  });
  
  // Create default general channel
  await addDoc(collection(firestore, 'campaigns', campaignRef.id, 'channels'), {
    id: 'general',
    name: 'General Chat',
    description: 'Main campaign discussion',
    type: 'text',
    visibility: 'all',
    createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
    createdBy: dmId
  });
  
  // Add DM as first member
  await setDoc(doc(firestore, 'campaigns', campaignRef.id, 'members', dmId), {
    userId: dmId,
    role: 'dm',
    status: 'active',
    joinedAt: serverTimestamp(),
    lastActive: serverTimestamp()
  });
  
  return campaignRef;
}

export async function joinCampaign(firestore, campaignId, userId, characterInfo = {}) {
  // Implementation for joining campaigns
}

export async function searchCampaigns(firestore, filters = {}) {
  // Implementation for campaign discovery
}
```

## Phase 3: Migration Strategy

### 3.1 Backward Compatibility

1. **Preserve General Chat**: Keep existing `/messages` collection as "lobby" chat
2. **Gradual Migration**: Allow users to access both old and new systems during transition
3. **Data Preservation**: No existing user data or messages are lost

### 3.2 Migration Steps

1. **Deploy Campaign Infrastructure** (no user-facing changes)
   - Add new collections and security rules
   - Deploy campaign service functions
   - Add campaign context (unused initially)

2. **Soft Launch Campaign Features**
   - Add campaign creation for DMs
   - Add campaign browser (discoverable but not prominent)
   - Keep existing chat as default entry point

3. **Feature Promotion**
   - Add campaign switcher to main navigation
   - Update onboarding to highlight campaigns
   - Add campaign recommendations

4. **Full Transition**
   - Make campaigns the primary entry point
   - Rebrand general chat as "Lobby"
   - Add migration prompts for existing users

### 3.3 User Communication

- **In-app notifications**: Inform about new campaign features
#### Stretch goals:
- **Migration incentives**: Special badges for early campaign adopters
- **Tutorial flow**: Guide DMs through campaign creation process

## Phase 4: D&D-Specific Enhancements

### 4.1 Campaign-Specific Features

```javascript
// Future enhancements to build on campaign foundation
- Character sheet integration
- Dice rolling with campaign history
- Session notes and summaries
- Initiative tracking
- Campaign calendar/scheduling
- Map and image sharing per campaign
- DM tools (NPC notes, plot tracking)
- Campaign stats and analytics
```

### 4.2 Social Features

```javascript
// Community building features
- DM ratings and reviews
- Player testimonials
- Campaign showcases
- Looking-for-group (LFG) board
- Mentorship matching (experienced DMs with new players)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Required New Hooks

```javascript
// src/hooks/useCampaigns.js
export function useCampaigns(userId) {
  // Fetch user's campaigns and memberships
}

// src/hooks/useCampaignMembers.js
export function useCampaignMembers(campaignId) {
  // Real-time campaign member list
}

// src/hooks/useCampaignChannels.js
export function useCampaignChannels(campaignId) {
  // Channel list for campaign
}

// src/hooks/useCampaignSearch.js
export function useCampaignSearch(filters) {
  // Search and filter campaigns
}
```

### Database Indexes Needed

```javascript
// Firestore composite indexes
campaigns:
  - (visibility, status, lastActivity DESC)
  - (gameSystem, visibility, status)
  - (tags array-contains, visibility, status)
  - (dmId, status, createdAt DESC)

campaigns/{campaignId}/members:
  - (status, role, joinedAt)

campaigns/{campaignId}/channels/{channelId}/messages:
  - (createdAt DESC) // Same as existing messages
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Only load campaign data when needed
2. **Pagination**: Campaign browsing and member lists
3. **Caching**: Cache user's active campaigns locally
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for join/leave actions

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Complex data migration | High | Medium | Phased rollout with backward compatibility |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Careful indexing and lazy loading |
| Security rule complexity | High | Medium | Thorough testing and rule validation |
| State management complexity | Medium | Medium | Gradual context introduction |

### Product Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| User adoption resistance | High | Medium | Preserve familiar UX, gradual introduction |
| DM engagement required | High | High | DM onboarding incentives and tools |
| Campaign discovery challenge | Medium | Medium | Robust search and recommendation system |
| Content moderation scaling | Medium | Low | Leverage existing moderation, per-campaign delegation |

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Database performance maintains <100ms query times
- No increase in error rates during migration
- 99.9% uptime during rollout phases

### Product Metrics
- 50% of existing users create or join a campaign within 30 days
- Average of 2.5 campaigns per active user
- 80% DM retention rate (DMs who create campaigns remain active)
- 60% campaign completion rate (campaigns that reach "active" status)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 3-4 weeks
  - Data model design and implementation
  - Security rules and basic services
  - Database setup and testing

- **Phase 2 (Core Implementation)**: 4-6 weeks
  - Campaign management components
  - Modified chat components for campaign context
  - User interface integration

- **Phase 3 (Migration & Polish)**: 2-3 weeks
  - Backward compatibility testing
  - User migration flows
  - Documentation and onboarding

- **Phase 4 (D&D Enhancements)**: Future roadmap
  - Campaign-specific features
  - Advanced D&D tooling integration
  - Social and discovery features

**Total estimated time for core campaign system: 9-13 weeks**

## Conclusion

This campaign system strategy provides a comprehensive path from the current single-room chat to a full-featured D&D campaign platform. The phased approach ensures minimal disruption to existing users while building a foundation for rich D&D-specific features. The architecture is designed to scale with the community and provides clear extension points for future enhancements.

The key to success will be maintaining the excellent chat experience users already enjoy while gradually introducing the value of campaign-based organization and D&D-specific community features.

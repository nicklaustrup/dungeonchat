## üß™ How to Test

### Option 1: Quick Test (2 Browser Windows)

1. **Add the demo route to your app:**

Edit `src/App.js` and add this import and route:

```javascript
import VoiceChatDemo from './pages/VoiceChatDemo/VoiceChatDemo';

// In your Routes section, add:
<Route path="/voice-demo" element={<VoiceChatDemo />} />
<Route path="/voice-demo/:campaignId" element={<VoiceChatDemo />} />
```

2. **Start your app:**
```bash
npm start
```

3. **Open two browser windows:**
   - Window 1: http://localhost:3000/voice-demo
   - Window 2: http://localhost:3000/voice-demo (incognito or different browser)

4. **Sign in with different Google accounts in each window**

5. **Click "Join Voice" in both windows**

6. **Test the features:**
   - See both participants in the list
   - Speak and watch audio level bars
   - Toggle mute/unmute
   - Listen to each other's audio

---

### Option 2: Test in Existing Campaign

If you have campaigns set up:

1. **Add VoiceChatPanel to a campaign page:**

```javascript
import VoiceChatPanel from '../components/Voice/VoiceChatPanel';

// In your campaign component:
<VoiceChatPanel campaignId={campaignId} roomId="voice-general" />
```

2. **Open campaign in two windows with different users**

3. **Join voice and test**

## üîç What to Look For

### Console Logs (Browser DevTools F12)
You should see logs like:
```
[Signaling] Sent offer from user1 to user2
[WebRTC] Created peer connection with user2 (initiator: true)
[WebRTC] Received remote track from user2
[useVoiceChat] Successfully joined voice chat
```

### Firebase Console
Check your Firebase Console:
- **Realtime Database:** Should see `voiceSignaling/{campaignId}` data
- **Firestore:** Should see `campaigns/{campaignId}/voiceRooms` collection

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: No audio from remote peer
**Fix:** Check if both users are using headphones (avoids echo cancellation issues)

### Issue: Connection state stuck on "connecting"
**Fix:** 
1. Check browser console for WebRTC errors
2. Verify Firebase rules were deployed
3. Try refreshing both windows

### Issue: Microphone not working
**Fix:**
1. Check browser microphone permissions
2. Verify you're on `localhost` or `https://`
3. Try different browser (Chrome works best)

### Issue: Can't see other participant
**Fix:**
1. Verify both users are in the same campaign ID
2. Check Firestore participants collection
3. Look for signaling errors in console

## üìù Quick Integration Guide

To add voice chat to any campaign page:

```javascript
import VoiceChatPanel from '../components/Voice/VoiceChatPanel';

function CampaignPage() {
  const { campaignId } = useParams();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing campaign UI */}
      
      {/* Add voice chat panel */}
      <VoiceChatPanel 
        campaignId={campaignId} 
        roomId="voice-general" 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it! The component handles everything else.

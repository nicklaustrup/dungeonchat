# VTT Lighting & Fog of War Features - Implementation Summary

## Three New Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Light Sources Dispel Fog of War 🔥💡

Light sources (torches, lanterns, magical lights, etc.) now automatically reveal fog of war around them!

**How It Works:**
- Every light source reveals fog in a radius based on its light radius
- Revelation radius = `Math.ceil(light.radius / gridSize)` grid cells
- Updates automatically when lights are placed, moved, or deleted
- Works with all light types (torch, lantern, candle, magical, etc.)

**Player Token Enhancement:**
- Base player vision: **3 grid cells** radius
- If carrying a light (within 30px): **5 grid cells** radius
- Detection: Checks if any light source is within 30 pixels of player token
- Torches and lanterns significantly extend exploration range

**Examples:**
- **Torch** (40px radius): Reveals ~1 grid cell radius in fog
- **Lantern** (60px radius): Reveals ~1-2 grid cell radius
- **Light Spell** (80px radius): Reveals ~2 grid cells radius
- **Campfire** (120px radius): Reveals ~2-3 grid cells radius

**Use Cases:**
- Dark dungeons - players need light sources to explore
- Stealth scenarios - lights attract attention but reveal areas
- Resource management - torches run out (future feature)
- Tactical decisions - where to place light sources

### 2. Player View Toggle (DM Only) 👁️

New button allows DMs to preview exactly what players see!

**Location:** VTT Toolbar (after Lighting button)

**Button Details:**
- Icon: Eye icon (👁️)
- Label: "Player View" when off, "DM View" when on
- Appears only for DMs (inside `isUserDM` block)
- Active state styling when toggled on

**What It Does:**
- **Hides all hidden tokens** - Shows map as players see it
- **Respects fog of war** - Same fog visibility as players
- **No special privileges** - Exactly matches player experience
- **Single click toggle** - Easy to switch back and forth

**Use Cases:**
- Verify enemy placement before revealing
- Check fog of war coverage
- Plan encounters from player perspective
- Test lighting setups
- Quality control before session starts

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// In VTTSession
const [playerViewMode, setPlayerViewMode] = useState(false);

// Pass to MapCanvas
<MapCanvas
  isDM={isUserDM}
  playerViewMode={playerViewMode}
  ...
/>

// In MapCanvas - token visibility
if (token.hidden && (!isDM || playerViewMode)) {
  return null; // Hide hidden tokens in player view
}
```

### 3. Hidden Token Indicator (Closed Eye Icon) 🚫👁️

Hidden tokens now display a clear visual indicator for DMs!

**Visual Design:**
- **Icon:** Closed eye emoji (👁️‍🗨️)
- **Position:** Top-right corner of token
- **Background:** Dark circle (radius 12px, 85% opacity)
- **Size:** 16pt font, clearly visible
- **Visibility:** DMs only (never shown to players)

**Appearance:**
```
┌──────────────┐
│      [👁️‍🗨️]  │  ← Hidden indicator
│   TOKEN      │
│   IMAGE      │
│     HERE     │
└──────────────┘
```

**Use Cases:**
- Quick identification of hidden tokens
- Prevent accidental reveals
- Manage staged encounters
- Track token visibility state
- Visual confirmation of hide/unhide actions

**Implementation:**
```jsx
{/* Hidden indicator - Closed eye icon (DM only) */}
{token.hidden && (
  <Group x={tokenSize / 2 - 16} y={-tokenSize / 2 + 4}>
    <Circle radius={12} fill="#000" opacity={0.85} />
    <Text text="👁️‍🗨️" fontSize={16} fill="#fff" x={-8} y={-8} opacity={0.9} />
  </Group>
)}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **VTTSession.jsx**
   - Added `playerViewMode` state
   - Added Player View toggle button
   - Passes `playerViewMode` prop to MapCanvas

2. **MapCanvas.jsx**
   - Added `playerViewMode` prop
   - New `useEffect` for light-based fog reveal
   - Updated token visibility logic
   - Calculates light reveal radius from pixel radius
   - Checks for nearby lights to extend player vision

3. **TokenSprite.jsx**
   - Added hidden indicator Group component
   - Positioned at top-right corner
   - Only renders when `token.hidden === true`

### Integration Points

**Fog of War Service:**
```javascript
// Reveal fog around each light
for (const light of lights) {
  const gridX = Math.floor(light.position.x / map.gridSize);
  const gridY = Math.floor(light.position.y / map.gridSize);
  const revealRadius = Math.ceil(light.radius / map.gridSize);
  await fogOfWarService.revealArea(firestore, campaignId, mapId, gridX, gridY, revealRadius);
}
```

**Player Vision with Lights:**
```javascript
// Check if player has nearby light source
const hasNearbyLight = lights.some(light => {
  const distance = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  return distance < 30; // Within 30px = carrying light
});

const revealRadius = hasNearbyLight ? 5 : 3; // Extended vision with light
```

**Token Visibility:**
```javascript
// Hide from players AND from DMs in player view mode
if (token.hidden && (!isDM || playerViewMode)) {
  return null;
}
```

## User Workflows

### DM: Setting Up Dark Dungeon
1. Enable Fog of War on map
2. Lower ambient light to 10-20% (dark)
3. Place torch/lantern light sources at key locations
4. Toggle "Player View" to verify what players will see
5. Fog automatically reveals around each light source
6. Add hidden enemy tokens with clear eye indicators
7. Start session - players explore with limited vision

### Player: Exploring with Torch
1. Player token enters dark area (fog of war)
2. DM places torch light near player token (within 30px)
3. Player vision extends from 3 to 5 grid cells
4. Fog reveals in 5-cell radius as player moves
5. Without torch: only 3-cell radius visible
6. Strategic light placement becomes important

### DM: Managing Hidden Tokens
1. Create enemy tokens and mark as hidden
2. Eye icon appears on each hidden token (👁️‍🗨️)
3. Position enemies behind fog of war
4. Toggle "Player View" to confirm they're hidden
5. When ready, unhide tokens to reveal enemies
6. Eye icon disappears when token is visible

## Testing Checklist

### Light Fog Reveal
- [ ] Place torch on map - fog reveals in 1-2 cell radius
- [ ] Place lantern - larger fog reveal radius
- [ ] Place magical light - fog reveals around it
- [ ] Move light source - fog updates in new position
- [ ] Delete light - fog remains revealed (persistent)
- [ ] Multiple lights - each reveals its own area

### Player View Toggle
- [ ] Button only visible to DM
- [ ] Click to toggle on - label changes to "DM View"
- [ ] Hidden tokens disappear when active
- [ ] Click again to toggle off - hidden tokens reappear
- [ ] Fog of war same as player experience
- [ ] No selection or editing possible in player view

### Hidden Token Indicator
- [ ] Create token and mark as hidden
- [ ] Eye icon appears in top-right corner
- [ ] Icon clearly visible on all token sizes
- [ ] Icon disappears when token unhidden
- [ ] Multiple hidden tokens all show icon
- [ ] Icon never visible to players (only DM)

### Player with Torch
- [ ] Player token alone: 3-cell fog reveal radius
- [ ] Place torch within 30px of player
- [ ] Fog reveal radius increases to 5 cells
- [ ] Move player with torch - extended vision follows
- [ ] Remove torch - vision returns to 3 cells
- [ ] Multiple players with torches - each gets boost

## Known Limitations

1. **Light Attachment:** Lights don't auto-follow tokens yet
   - Manual: Place light near player token (within 30px)
   - Future: Add `attachedToTokenId` property for auto-following

2. **Light Resource Management:** No torch burning/duration
   - All lights are permanent until deleted
   - Future: Add duration/fuel mechanics

3. **Darkvision:** No special vision types yet
   - All players use same base vision (3 cells)
   - Future: Add darkvision, blindsight, etc. to tokens

4. **Line of Sight:** No wall blocking
   - Lights and vision work through walls
   - Future: Add dynamic line-of-sight calculations

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Possibilities:
- **Token-Attached Lights** - Lights follow token movement
- **Vision Types** - Darkvision, blindsight, truesight
- **Light Duration** - Torches burn out over time
- **Dynamic Shadows** - Walls block light/vision
- **Colored Fog** - Different fog colors for magical darkness
- **Stealth Mode** - Players can extinguish lights
- **Light Intensity Zones** - Bright/dim/dark areas
- **Token Vision Arcs** - Directional vision (facing)

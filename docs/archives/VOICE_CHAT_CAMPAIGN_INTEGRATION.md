---

## Voice Room Structure

### Room Naming Convention
- **Default room**: `voice-general` (used in both locations)
- Future: Could add per-channel rooms (e.g., `voice-party-chat`, `voice-ooc`)

### Firestore Path
```
campaigns/{campaignId}/voiceRooms/voice-general
```

### Participants
All campaign members can join voice chat. Security rules ensure:
- Only campaign members can read voice room
- Any campaign member can join as participant
- Users can only update their own participant data
- DM can remove any participant

---

## Technical Details

### Component Reusability
The same `VoiceChatPanel` component is used in three places:
1. `/voice-demo` - Demo/testing page
2. Campaign Dashboard - Dedicated tab
3. Campaign Chat - Floating panel

**Props**:
```javascript
<VoiceChatPanel 
  campaignId={campaignId}  // Required
  roomId="voice-general"   // Default room ID
/>
```

### State Management
- Each instance manages its own voice connection
- Multiple tabs can't join simultaneously (WebRTC limitation)
- Leaving one location automatically disconnects

### Styling Contexts
1. **Demo Page**: Full-width centered layout
2. **Dashboard Tab**: Centered with max-width
3. **Floating Panel**: Compact, fixed positioning

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Dashboard Tab (Mobile)
- Full-width voice panel
- Stacked layout for participants
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Responsive padding

### Floating Panel (Mobile)
```css
.floating-voice-panel {
  width: 380px;
  max-width: calc(100vw - 40px);  /* Respects screen width */
  bottom: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

- Shrinks to fit screen
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Easy to close on small screens

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Future Enhancement)

Planned shortcuts:
- `Ctrl/Cmd + M` - Toggle mute
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + V` - Toggle voice panel
- `Space` (hold) - Push-to-talk mode

---

## Performance Considerations

### Multiple Tabs Warning
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Opening the same campaign in multiple browser tabs will cause conflicts:
- Only one tab should join voice at a time
- WebRTC connections are tab-specific
- Use only one tab per user

### Connection Limits
- **Recommended**: 2-6 users in voice (mesh topology)
- **Maximum**: 8 users before quality degrades
- Each user connects P2P to every other user

### Resource Usage Per Instance
- CPU: Minimal (~1-2%)
- Memory: ~5-10MB per connection
- Bandwidth: 32-64 kbps upload per peer

---

## Security & Permissions

### Campaign Access Required
- Users must be campaign members
- Firebase rules enforce campaign membership
- Demo campaigns (`test-campaign-*`) still work for testing

### Voice Room Permissions
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/voiceRooms/{roomId} {
  allow read: if isCampaignMember();
  allow create, delete: if isDM() || isDemoCampaign();
  
  match /participants/{userId} {
    allow create: if request.auth.uid == userId && isCampaignMember();
    allow update: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    allow delete: if request.auth.uid == userId || isDM();
  }
}
```

## Known Limitations

## Troubleshooting

### "Voice button missing in chat"

- Campaign must be loaded successfully
- Refresh page if header doesn't appear

### "Can't join voice from two places"
- Only one active connection per user
- Leave from one location before joining another
- Close all duplicate browser tabs

### "Floating panel covers chat"
- Panel fixed to bottom-right
- Scroll chat if needed
- Close panel with X button
- Reposition: planned for future update

### "Lost connection when switching tabs"
- Voice intentionally stays connected when switching dashboard tabs
- Voice disconnects when leaving campaign entirely
- Refresh to rejoin if needed

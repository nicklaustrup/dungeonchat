## Tips & Best Practices

### üé® Creating Atmosphere

1. **Dungeons**: Low ambient (20-30%), strategic torch placement
2. **Taverns**: Warm lanterns and fireplace, medium ambient (50-60%)
3. **Outdoors Day**: High ambient (80-100%), minimal light sources
4. **Outdoors Night**: Low ambient (10-20%), campfires and torches
5. **Magical Scenes**: Colored lights, animated effects, varying intensities

### ‚ö° Performance

- Keep lights to reasonable numbers (5-15 per map)
- Use larger radius lights for big areas
- Disable lighting when not needed
- Turn off flicker/animation for better performance

### üé≠ Dramatic Effects

- **Sunrise/Sunset**: Slowly adjust time of day slider during session
- **Thunderstorm**: Flash ambient light to 100% briefly
- **Magical Ritual**: Use multiple colored animated lights
- **Stealth Scene**: Drop ambient to near-zero, minimal lights
- **Boss Entrance**: Add dramatic colored lights when boss appears

### üó∫Ô∏è Map Considerations

- Works best with darker map images
- Bright maps may need very low ambient light
- Grid-enabled maps show light boundaries more clearly
- Consider map size when setting light radius

## Keyboard Shortcuts

(Future feature - coming in Phase 2)

- `L` - Toggle lighting on/off
- `Ctrl+L` - Open lighting panel
- `Click` (with Lighting tool) - Place light at cursor

---

## Troubleshooting

### Lights Not Showing

1. Check that Lighting is toggled ON in panel
2. Verify lights have intensity > 0
3. Check if ambient light is too high (blocks light visibility)
4. Ensure map is loaded

### Map Too Dark

1. Increase **Ambient Light** slider
2. Add more light sources
3. Increase light **Radius** and **Intensity**
4. Change **Time of Day** to daytime (12:00)

### Map Too Bright

1. Decrease **Ambient Light** slider
2. Remove unnecessary lights
3. Change **Time of Day** to night (0:00)
4. Decrease light intensity

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce number of lights on map
2. Disable **Flicker** and **Animated** effects
3. Use fewer colored lights
4. Lower light radius where possible

# Phase 2F: Session Planning & Content Management

**Status**: ðŸš€ IN PROGRESS  
**Start Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

## Technical Requirements

### New Services
1. `sessionService.js` - Session notes CRUD operations
2. `encounterService.js` - Encounter management functions
3. `scheduleService.js` - Calendar and scheduling operations
4. `partyService.js` - Party management utilities

### Firebase Structure
```
campaigns/{campaignId}/
  â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/{sessionId}
  â”œâ”€â”€ encounters/{encounterId}
  â”œâ”€â”€ schedule/{scheduleId}
  â”œâ”€â”€ timeline/{eventId}
  â””â”€â”€ party/{partyDataId}
```

### Security Rules
```javascript
// Session notes - DM can write, members can read shared notes
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/sessions/{sessionId} {
  allow read: if isCampaignMember(campaignId);
  allow write: if isCampaignDM(campaignId);
}

// Encounters - DM only
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/encounters/{encounterId} {
  allow read: if isCampaignDM(campaignId);
  allow write: if isCampaignDM(campaignId);
}

// Schedule - members can read, DM can write
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/schedule/{scheduleId} {
  allow read: if isCampaignMember(campaignId);
  allow write: if isCampaignDM(campaignId);
  // Allow members to update their availability
  allow update: if isCampaignMember(campaignId) && 
    request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys()
    .hasOnly(['playerAvailability']);
}

// Party data - members can read, DM can write
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/party/{partyDataId} {
  allow read: if isCampaignMember(campaignId);
  allow write: if isCampaignDM(campaignId);
}
```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Rich text editor complexity | Medium | Use proven library (Quill, TinyMCE) |
| Real-time sync performance | High | Implement debouncing and optimistic updates |
| Complex scheduling logic | Medium | Use established date libraries (date-fns) |
| Data model complexity | High | Thorough planning and testing before implementation |

### User Experience Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Feature overload | High | Progressive disclosure, tabbed interfaces |
| Learning curve for DMs | Medium | Tooltips, tutorials, sensible defaults |
| Mobile usability | Medium | Touch-friendly controls, responsive design |

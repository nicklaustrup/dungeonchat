# Campaign Member List Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Clickable Usernames Not Working
**Problem**: Member usernames in the Members list had the `clickable-username` class but clicks were being blocked by parent elements.

**Solution**: 
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to the username click handler to prevent event bubbling
- Added CSS z-index positioning to ensure clickable usernames are above other elements
- Wrapped MemberItem in a component that properly handles click events

### 2. Profile Pictures Not Rendering
**Problem**: Profile pictures were not displaying in the member list - only role icons were shown.

**Root Causes**:
1. Hook was returning `profileData` but component was destructuring as `profile`
2. `useCampaignMembers` was looking for `photoURL` field instead of `profilePictureURL`
3. Field name mismatch between what's stored in Firestore and what was being accessed

**Solution**:
- Fixed destructuring: Changed from `{ profile }` to `{ profileData }` in useCachedUserProfileData
- Updated `useCampaignMembers` to check both `profilePictureURL` and `photoURL` fields
- Added proper rendering of profile pictures in the member avatar section
- Falls back to role icon if no profile picture is available
- Checks multiple sources for profile picture: `profilePictureURL`, `photoURL`, and from member data
- Added debug logging to trace profile data flow

### 3. Caching Not Used
**Problem**: The component was not using the caching system, making unnecessary Firebase calls.

**Solution**:
- Imported and implemented `useCachedUserProfileData` hook for each member
- Created a `MemberItem` sub-component that uses cached profile data
- Each member now uses cached profile information reducing Firebase reads

## Changes Made

### File: `CampaignMemberList.js`

#### Added Import
```javascript
import { useCachedUserProfileData } from '../../services/cache';
```

#### Created MemberItem Component
- **FIXED**: Changed from `const { profile }` to `const { profileData }` - this was the main bug!
- Uses `useCachedUserProfileData(member.userId)` for each member
- Pulls profile picture from multiple sources (profilePictureURL, photoURL)
- Renders profile picture if available, falls back to role icon
- Properly handles click events with `e.stopPropagation()`
- Added debug logging to trace profile data and image URLs

#### Simplified Rendering
- Changed from inline rendering to using the `MemberItem` component
- Each member is rendered via: `<MemberItem key={member.userId} member={member} />`

### File: `useCampaignMembers.js`

#### Fixed Profile Picture Field
- **FIXED**: Changed `memberData.photoURL = profileData.photoURL` to check `profileData.profilePictureURL` first
- Now properly reads the correct field from Firestore userProfiles collection
```javascript
memberData.photoURL = profileData.profilePictureURL || profileData.photoURL || null;
```

### File: `CampaignMemberList.css`

#### Enhanced Avatar Styling
```css
.member-avatar {
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  /* ... */
  overflow: hidden;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

.member-avatar-img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

#### Fixed Clickable Username Z-Index
```css
.member-name .clickable-username {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  display: inline-block;
}
```

## Benefits

### Performance
✅ **Reduced Firebase Reads**: Using cached profile data instead of real-time queries for each member
✅ **Faster Rendering**: Cached data loads instantly from memory
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Cache automatically updates when profiles change

### User Experience
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Profile pictures now display for all members
✅ **Clickable Names**: All member usernames are now properly clickable
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Same click behavior as other parts of the app (Friends List, Campaign Browser, etc.)

### Code Quality
✅ **Component Reusability**: MemberItem component is cleaner and more maintainable
✅ **Better Data Flow**: Uses established caching patterns from the app
✅ **Event Handling**: Proper event propagation control

# Party Panel Enhancement - Implementation Summary

**Date Completed:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phases 1-5 Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Container Constraints (COMPLETE)
The `.party-management` div now has proper constraints to prevent it from extending beyond the sidebar container:
- Added `max-width: 100%`
- Added `box-sizing: border-box`
- Added `overflow-x: hidden`

**Result:** Party management panel now respects sidebar boundaries regardless of resize.

---

### ✅ Phase 2: Character Portraits (COMPLETE)
Member chips now display character portraits:
- **48x48 pixel portraits** on member chips
- **64x64 pixel portraits** on character sheet preview
- **Fallback system**: Shows character initials in a gradient background when no portrait exists
- Supports both `avatarUrl` and `portraitUrl` fields
- Rounded corners with border styling

**Result:** Visual representation of characters in the party strip.

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Active Member Selection (COMPLETE)
Member chips now show visual feedback when selected:
- **Blue border** (`2px solid var(--primary-color)`) on active chip
- **Box shadow** with blue glow effect
- **Smooth transition** animations
- Only one member can be active at a time
- Clicking a member chip selects it and displays their character sheet

**Result:** Clear visual indicator of which character is currently selected.

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Character Sheet Preview (COMPLETE)
When a member is clicked, a detailed character sheet preview appears showing:

**Header Section:**
- Large character portrait (64x64)
- Character name (prominent heading)
- Full class/race information (e.g., "Level 5 Elf Wizard")
- Close button (×) to dismiss preview

**Stats Grid:**
- **Experience Points** (formatted with commas)
- **Proficiency Bonus** (calculated or from character data)

**Ability Scores:**
All six abilities displayed in a grid:
- STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
- Shows score (e.g., 16)
- Shows modifier (e.g., +3) with blue highlight

**Action Button:**
- "📋 View Full Character Sheet" button
- Styled prominently for future functionality

**Result:** Comprehensive at-a-glance character information without leaving the party panel.

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Inventory Placeholder (COMPLETE)
Added inventory section below character sheet preview:
- **Header**: "📦 Inventory" with icon
- **Body**: "Coming soon" message
- **Styling**: Dashed border to indicate placeholder
- Consistent with other panel styling

**Result:** Sets user expectations for future inventory feature.

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

1. **Portrait URLs**: Need to verify database schema has `avatarUrl` or `portraitUrl` field
2. **Race Field**: May need to add if not present in character data
3. **View Full Sheet**: Button currently has no action (placeholder for Phase 6)
4. **Performance**: Consider memoization if character list is very large
5. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

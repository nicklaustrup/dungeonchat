Fix clickable usernames and profile pictures in campaign members

- Fixed clickable username styling by moving CSS from standalone file to App.css
- Fixed FriendsListModal search results to make usernames clickable
- Fixed CampaignMemberList profile pictures not displaying (destructuring bug)
- Fixed useCampaignMembers to use correct field name (profilePictureURL)
- Added proper caching with useCachedUserProfileData hook
- Added z-index and stopPropagation for better click handling
- Removed unused clickable-username.css file

Bugs fixed:
1. Clickable username CSS was never imported (moved to App.css)
2. Search results usernames were not clickable (added click handler)
3. Profile pictures not showing due to wrong variable name (profile vs profileData)
4. useCampaignMembers looking at wrong field (photoURL vs profilePictureURL)

All clickable usernames now work consistently across the app with proper styling.

# Clickable Username Fix

## Problem
- Usernames in Search Results within the Friends List modal were not clickable
- Clickable username styling was not rendering throughout the app
- The `clickable-username.css` file was created but never imported anywhere

## Solution

### 1. Moved CSS to App.css
**File**: `src/App.css`

Moved the clickable username styles from the standalone `src/styles/clickable-username.css` file into `App.css` at the end of the file. This ensures the styles are loaded globally when the app starts.

Added styles:
```css
/* Global clickable username styles */
.clickable-username {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: #1976d2;
  text-decoration: none;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.clickable-username:hover {
  color: #0d47a1;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

.clickable-username:active {
  transform: scale(0.98);
}

/* Dark theme support */
.dark-theme .clickable-username {
  color: #64b5f6;
}

.dark-theme .clickable-username:hover {
  color: #42a5f5;
}
```

### 2. Fixed Search Results in Friends List
**File**: `src/components/FriendsListModal/FriendsListModal.js`

Updated the search results section to:
1. Wrap username in a `user-info` div (consistent with other tabs)
2. Add `clickable-username` class to the username span
3. Add `onClick` handler to open the user profile modal

**Before**:
```jsx
<span className="user-name">{result.username}</span>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<div className="user-info" onClick={() => handleViewProfile(result.id)}>
  <img
    src={result.profilePictureURL || '/logo192.png'}
    alt={result.username}
    className="user-avatar"
  />
  <span className="user-name clickable-username">{result.username}</span>
</div>
```

### 3. Cleanup
Deleted the unused `src/styles/clickable-username.css` file since its contents are now in `App.css`.

## Result
✅ Clickable username styles now apply throughout the entire app
✅ Search results usernames in Friends List modal are now clickable
✅ Clicking usernames opens the user profile modal
✅ Consistent behavior across all locations (Friends List, Campaign Dashboard, Campaign Browser, etc.)

## Where Clickable Usernames Work
- ✅ Campaign Dashboard - DM name on Overview tab
- ✅ Campaign Browser - DM names in campaign listings
- ✅ Campaign Member List - Member usernames
- ✅ Campaign Preview - DM name
- ✅ Friends List Modal - All tabs (Friends, Pending, Blocked)
- ✅ Friends List Modal - Search Results (FIXED)
- ✅ Voice Chat Panel - Participant names

# Token Manager Upgrade - Phase 1 & 2 Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Phase 1: Token Art Upload in Palette Tab
**Goal**: Move upload functionality into Palette tab so ALL token types can have custom art

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `TokenArtUpload.jsx` component
  - Drag-and-drop file upload with react-dropzone
  - Preview display for current token art
  - Update and Remove buttons
  - File validation (5MB max, image types only)
  - Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Integrated into `TokenPalette.jsx`
  - Upload section appears at top when token selected
  - Works for ALL token types (PC, NPC, Monster, etc.)
  - Replaces mini preview that was only shown for existing images
- ✅ Added upload handlers to `TokenManager.jsx`
  - `handleUploadArt(file)` - Uploads image to Firebase Storage
  - `handleRemoveArt()` - Removes imageUrl from token
  - Proper loading states and error handling

**Result**: Users can now add custom artwork to ANY token type, not just player characters!

### Phase 2: Active Tokens Tab
**Goal**: Replace Upload tab with Active tab showing all deployed tokens and lights with camera centering

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `ActiveTokensTab.jsx`
  - Real-time subscription to active tokens (staged: false)
  - Real-time subscription to all lights on map
  - Organized sections for Tokens and Lights
  - Empty state UI with helpful messaging
  - Loading and error states
- ✅ Created `ActiveTokenItem.jsx`
  - Token preview (custom image or colored circle)
  - Token name and type badge
  - Focus button (🎯) to center camera
  - Edit button (✏️) to open token properties
- ✅ Created `ActiveLightItem.jsx`
  - Glowing light indicator with color
  - Light name or type label
  - Focus button (🎯) to center camera
  - Edit button (✏️) to open light editor modal
- ✅ Added handlers to `TokenManager.jsx`
  - `handleFocusToken(token)` - Centers camera and selects token
  - `handleFocusLight(light)` - Centers camera on light position
  - `handleEditToken(token)` - Selects token and switches to Palette
  - `handleEditLight(light)` - Opens light editor modal
- ✅ Replaced Upload tab button with Active tab button
- ✅ Complete styling with hover effects and animations

**Result**: Users can now see all active elements, quickly navigate to them, and edit them!

## 🔌 What Needs Integration

The Token Manager is ready to use, but **requires parent component wiring** to function fully:

### Required Props for TokenManager

```jsx
<TokenManager
  // ... existing props (campaignId, mapId, selectedToken, etc.)
  onCenterCamera={handleCenterCamera}      // NEW - Camera centering
  onOpenLightEditor={handleOpenLightEditor} // NEW - Light editor modal
  onTokenSelect={handleTokenSelect}         // NEW - Token selection
/>
```

### Implementation in VTTSession.jsx (or MapCanvas parent)

#### 1. Camera Centering Handler

```javascript
const handleCenterCamera = (x, y) => {
  const stage = stageRef.current;
  if (!stage) return;
  
  const width = stage.width();
  const height = stage.height();
  
  // Calculate position to center on (x,y)
  const newPos = {
    x: width / 2 - x * stageScale,
    y: height / 2 - y * stageScale
  };
  
  setStagePos(newPos);
};
```

#### 2. Light Editor Handler

```javascript
const handleOpenLightEditor = (light) => {
  setSelectedLight(light);
  setShowLightEditorModal(true);
};
```

#### 3. Token Selection Handler

```javascript
const handleTokenSelect = (tokenId) => {
  setSelectedTokenId(tokenId);
};
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate: Parent Integration
1. Open `VTTSession.jsx` or the component that renders `TokenManager`
2. Add the three handlers shown above
3. Pass them as props to `TokenManager`
4. Test camera centering and light editing

### Phase 3: Light Token Selectability (~2-3 hours)
- Add click handlers to `LightingLayer.jsx`
- Make lights selectable like tokens
- Show selection indicator (glowing ring)
- Pass `selectedLightId` through props

### Phase 4: Iterative Light Naming (~1-2 hours)
- Create `generateLightName()` utility
- Auto-name lights: "Torch 1", "Lantern 2", etc.
- Update light creation flow
- Make names editable

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (~2-3 hours)
- Full system testing
- Fix any bugs discovered
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing

### Phase 6: Documentation (~1-2 hours)
- Update user guides
- Create tutorial videos/GIFs
- Update README
- Document new features

## 💡 Key Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Only player tokens could have custom art
- ❌ Upload tab was separate, underutilized
- ❌ No way to see all active tokens at once
- ❌ No camera navigation to specific tokens
- ❌ Lights not editable from token manager

### After:
- ✅ **ALL** tokens can have custom art
- ✅ Upload integrated into Palette (always accessible)
- ✅ Active tab shows everything on the map
- ✅ Click to center camera on any token/light
- ✅ Quick edit access for both tokens and lights

---

## 📊 Time Investment

- **Planning**: 1 hour
- **Phase 1 Implementation**: 1.5 hours
- **Phase 2 Implementation**: 2 hours
- **Documentation**: 0.5 hours

**Total So Far**: ~5 hours
**Estimated Remaining**: 9-15 hours (Phases 3-6)

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Major milestones achieved**:
1. ✅ Token art upload democratized - no more PC-only restriction
2. ✅ Active management interface created - see everything at a glance
3. ✅ Camera navigation foundation laid - one click to focus
4. ✅ Light editing integration prepared - ready for modal hookup

**What users will love**:
- Upload custom art directly when editing any token
- See all active elements in one organized list
- Quickly navigate to any token or light on large maps
- Edit tokens and lights without hunting on the canvas

**Ready for**: Parent integration, then Phases 3-6!

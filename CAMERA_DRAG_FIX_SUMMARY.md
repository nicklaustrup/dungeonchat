# Camera Dragging Fix & Panel State Cleanup - Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Commit:** a89a2a3

## Problem Statement

The DM was unable to move the camera by dragging with the pointer tool. Additionally, several console logging and React useEffect issues were causing performance problems.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **boundaryMode defaulted to `'line'`** instead of `null`, preventing camera dragging
2. **Infinite console logging** from draggable prop calculation running on every render
3. **useEffect dependency issues** causing infinite re-renders (function dependencies changing)
4. **No state cleanup** when switching tools or closing panels

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Camera Dragging Not Working ✅
- **Problem:** Stage draggable condition checked `activeTool === 'pointer' && boundaryMode === null`, but `boundaryMode` defaulted to `'line'`
- **Solution:** Changed default `boundaryMode` from `'line'` to `null` in VTTSession.jsx
- **Result:** Camera now draggable by default with pointer tool

### 2. Infinite Console Logging ✅
- **Problem:** `[CAMERA DRAG DEBUG]` log inside draggable prop calculation executed hundreds of times per second
- **Solution:** Removed inline function from draggable prop, moved debug logging to useEffect
- **Result:** Clean console output, no performance impact

### 3. useEffect Re-render Issues ✅
- **Problem:** Fog subscription useEffect had function dependencies (`onFogGridColorChange`, etc.) that changed every render
- **Solution:** 
  - Removed function dependencies from fog subscription useEffect
  - Created separate useEffect for loading fog config with stable dependencies
  - Changed fog brush dependency from `fogData` (object) to `fogData?.enabled` (boolean)
- **Result:** No more infinite re-renders, proper React behavior

### 4. No Panel State Cleanup ✅
- **Problem:** When switching tools or closing panels, modes remained active (boundaryMode, fogBrushMode, etc.)
- **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive cleanup system

## Implementation Details

### Tool Switch Cleanup (MapToolbar.jsx)
When clicking any tool (pointer, pen, cone, etc.):
```javascript
- Close fog panel if open
- Close boundary panel if open  
- Close grid config if open
- Reset boundaryMode to null
- Reset fogBrushMode to 'reveal' (default)
- Reset boundaryBrushMode to 'paint' (default)
```

### Panel Close Cleanup

**Fog Panel Close:**
```javascript
- Close panel
- Reset fogBrushMode to 'reveal'
```

**Boundary Panel Close:**
```javascript
- Close panel
- Reset boundaryMode to null
- Reset boundaryBrushMode to 'paint'
```

## Files Modified

1. **VTTSession.jsx**
   - Changed `boundaryMode` default from `'line'` to `null`
   - Removed unused `handleBoundaryModeChange` function

2. **MapToolbar.jsx**
   - Added comprehensive state reset on tool change
   - Added state reset on panel close
   - Added grid config close on tool switch

3. **MapCanvas.jsx**
   - Fixed useEffect dependency arrays (fog subscription)
   - Created separate effect for fog config loading
   - Fixed fog brush dependency to prevent infinite loops
   - Added debug logging for boundaryMode changes
   - Removed inline function from draggable prop

4. **BoundaryPanel.jsx**
   - Removed unused imports (Eye, EyeOff)

5. **boundaryService.js**
   - Removed unused import (setDoc)

## Debug Tools Added

- `[BOUNDARY MODE DEBUG]` - Logs when boundaryMode changes
- `[MOUSE DOWN DEBUG]` - Logs mouse events with all relevant states
- `[DRAG START]` - Logs when camera drag begins
- `[DRAG END]` - Logs when camera drag ends

These can be removed in production or left for troubleshooting.

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Camera drags with pointer tool by default
- ✅ Camera drags after opening/closing fog panel
- ✅ Camera drags after opening/closing boundary panel
- ✅ Camera drags after switching between tools
- ✅ No infinite console logging
- ✅ No React useEffect warnings
- ✅ Fog panel closes when switching tools
- ✅ Boundary panel closes when switching tools
- ✅ Grid config closes when switching tools
- ✅ All modes reset to defaults when switching tools
- ✅ All modes reset when closing panels

## Future Improvements

Consider removing debug logging statements once the system is stable:
- `[BOUNDARY MODE DEBUG]` in MapCanvas.jsx line ~696
- `[MOUSE DOWN DEBUG]` in MapCanvas.jsx line ~1266
- `[DRAG START]` in MapCanvas.jsx line ~2065
- `[DRAG END]` in MapCanvas.jsx line ~926

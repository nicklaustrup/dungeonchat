# Token Manager Bug Fixes - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished: 6/7 Bugs Fixed!

All critical and high-priority bugs have been resolved. The Token Manager is now production-ready for Phase 4.

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### ✅ 1. Camera Centering Not Working (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Console error "Camera center function not available yet"

**Root Cause**: useEffect was checking `typeof onCenterCamera === 'function'` but it's a ref object, not a function.

**Solution**: Changed check to `typeof onCenterCamera === 'object' && onCenterCamera.current !== undefined`

**Impact**: Focus buttons now work! Camera centers on tokens and lights.

---

### ✅ 2. Ghost Token Always Visible (HIGH)
**Problem**: Dashed ghost placeholder visible even when not dragging

**Root Cause**: `showGhost={true}` hardcoded in MapCanvas token rendering

**Solution**: Set `showGhost={false}` - ghost only appears when `isDragging && dragStartPos` (controlled in TokenSprite)

**Impact**: Clean UI - ghosts only show during active drag operations

---

### ✅ 3. Light Markers Too Large (HIGH)
**Problem**: Light markers became giant 12px radius dots, very obtrusive

**Root Cause**: Phase 3 added large clickable markers for selection

**Solution**:
- Reduced clickable marker: 12px → 8px radius
- Reduced stroke: 2px → 1.5px width
- Dynamic opacity: 0.6 normal, 0.9 when selected
- Reduced center dot: 6px → 3px radius

**Impact**: Subtle, elegant light indicators that don't overwhelm the map

---

### ✅ 4. Section Headers Scroll Behind Content (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Token list scrolled up and covered "Tokens" and "Lights" headers

**Root Cause**: Transparent background allowed content to show through sticky headers

**Solution**:
- Solid background: `#2a2a3e`
- Higher z-index: 1 → 10
- Added box-shadow for depth
- Stronger border colors

**Impact**: Headers stay visible and readable while scrolling

---

### ✅ 5. Selected Token Blocks Active Tab (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Clicking Active tab didn't deselect token, making it hard to see the list

**Root Cause**: No deselection logic on tab change

**Solution**: Added `onTokenDeselect()` call when Active tab clicked

**Impact**: Clean state management - Active tab always shows full view

---

### ✅ 6. Tabs Overflow in Condensed View (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Active tab pushed off-screen when TokenManager narrow

**Root Cause**: Fixed padding and `white-space: nowrap` prevented shrinking

**Solution**: Added responsive CSS:
- `min-width: fit-content` baseline
- `@media (max-width: 500px)`: Compact padding, larger icons
- `@container (max-width: 380px)`: Icon-focused mode

**Impact**: Tabs remain accessible at all sidebar widths

---

### ⚠️ 7. Edit Button Opens Character Sheet (LOW) - PARTIAL
**Problem**: Edit should open character sheet for PC/NPC/Enemy, not just Palette tab

**Current State**: TODO comment added, type checking in place

**Next Steps**: Implement character sheet modal/panel integration

**Impact**: Low priority - Palette tab is acceptable fallback for now

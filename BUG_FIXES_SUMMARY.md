# Bug Fixes & Features Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the bug fixes and new features implemented in this session.

## 1. Ping Animation Fix âœ…

**Problem**: Pings appeared to clear immediately with no fade animation, despite having correct animation math.

**Root Cause**: React wasn't re-rendering during animation phases because the state array reference wasn't changing.

**Solution**: Added a 50ms interval to force re-renders during active pings:

```javascript
// MapCanvas.jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (pings.length === 0) return;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setPings(prev => [...prev]); // Force re-render every 50ms
  }, 50);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [pings.length]);
```

**Result**: Smooth 4-phase animation now visible (white flash â†’ transition to color â†’ hold â†’ fade)

---

## 2. Map Toolbar Drag Performance âœ…

**Problem**: Dragging the map toolbar was laggy and slow due to excessive setState calls in mousemove handler.

**Solution**: Implemented requestAnimationFrame to batch updates at 60fps:

```javascript
// MapToolbar.jsx
let animationFrameId = null;
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  if (animationFrameId) cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId);
  animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    const newX = e.clientX - dragOffset.x;
    const newY = e.clientY - dragOffset.y;
    const toolbarWidth = toolbarRef.current?.offsetWidth || 200;
    const toolbarHeight = toolbarRef.current?.offsetHeight || 400;
    const maxX = window.innerWidth - toolbarWidth;
    const maxY = window.innerHeight - toolbarHeight;
    setPosition({
      x: Math.max(0, Math.min(newX, maxX)),
      y: Math.max(0, Math.min(newY, maxY))
    });
  });
};
```

**Additional Fix**: Improved viewport constraints using actual toolbar dimensions to prevent going off-screen.

**Result**: Smooth 60fps dragging, toolbar stays fully on screen

## 3. Voice Chat UI Polish âœ…

**Problem**: Voice chat minimized bar had too much padding, hangup button wasn't visually distinct.

**Solution**: Updated VoiceChatPanel.css:

```css
/* Reduced padding */
.voice-minimized-bar {
  padding: 4px 8px; /* was 8px 12px */
  gap: 4px;
}

/* Smaller buttons */
.voice-minimized-bar button {
  min-width: 28px;  /* was 32px */
  min-height: 28px; /* was 32px */
  padding: 4px;     /* was 6px */
}

/* Red hangup button */
.voice-minimized-bar .btn-leave-voice {
  background: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.3);
  color: #f44336;
}
.voice-minimized-bar .btn-leave-voice:hover {
  background: rgba(244, 67, 54, 0.6);
  color: #ff5252;
}
```

**Result**: Compact, clean UI with visually distinct hangup button

## 4. Floating Panel System âœ…

**Problem**: Chat and Party panels had no popout/floating functionality.

**Solution**: 

### A. Created PartyPanel Component (194 lines)
- Full feature parity with ChatPanel
- Draggable by header (requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps)
- Resizable from bottom-right corner (350-900w Ã— 400-900h constraints)
- Minimizable (collapse to header bar)
- Dock/undock with ðŸ“Œ button
- Viewport constraints (can't go off-screen)
- Default size: 450Ã—650px
- Purple gradient header matching theme

### B. Created PartyPanel.css (114 lines)
- Floating mode: Fixed position with backdrop-filter blur
- Purple gradient header (#667eea â†’ #764ba2)
- Resize handle with gradient triangle indicator
- Docked mode: Simple wrapper for sidebar
- Matches ChatPanel styling for consistency

### C. Integrated into VTTSession
- Added imports for ChatPanel and PartyPanel
- Updated Chat button:
  - Click: Toggle sidebar/floating
  - Right-click: Pop out directly
  - Shows â¬œ indicator when floating
  - Title: "Session Chat (Click to toggle, Right-click to pop out)"

- Updated Party button:
  - Click: Toggle sidebar/floating
  - Right-click: Pop out directly
  - Shows â¬œ indicator when floating
  - Title: "Party Management (Click to toggle, Right-click to pop out)"

- Conditional rendering:
  ```javascript
  {floatingPanels.chat && (
    <ChatPanel
      campaignId={campaignId}
      isFloating={true}
      onClose={() => closeFloatingPanel('chat')}
      onDock={() => {
        closeFloatingPanel('chat');
        setActivePanel('chat');
        setIsSidebarOpen(true);
      }}
    />
  )}
  
  {floatingPanels.party && (
    <PartyPanel
      campaignId={campaignId}
      isFloating={true}
      onClose={() => closeFloatingPanel('party')}
      onDock={() => {
        closeFloatingPanel('party');
        setActivePanel('party');
        setIsSidebarOpen(true);
      }}
    />
  )}
  ```

**Result**: Full floating panel system with drag, resize, minimize, and dock functionality

## Performance Notes

- **Ping Animation**: 50ms interval = 20fps updates (sufficient for smooth fade)
- **Toolbar Drag**: requestAnimationFrame = 60fps (browser-optimal)
- **Panel Drag/Resize**: requestAnimationFrame = 60fps
- **Memory**: All intervals properly cleaned up in useEffect return functions
- **Bundle Size**: PartyPanel adds ~8KB (component + CSS)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Mobile**: Floating panels not optimized for touch devices (resize handle small)
2. **Multi-Monitor**: Panels constrained to primary window, not multi-monitor aware
3. **Panel Persistence**: Panel positions not saved to localStorage (resets on refresh)
4. **Max Panels**: No enforced limit on number of floating panels (could cause clutter)

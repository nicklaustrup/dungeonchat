# Issue Resolution Summary

## Issue 1: Mobile Image Upload - FIXED âœ…

**Error**: `FirebaseError: Firebase Storage: User does not have permission to access 'images/xgM4VfIEC1h6osLiXhhYMLVd3c03/1759200298678.jpg'. (storage/unauthorized)`

**Root Cause**: Firebase Storage rules did not include permissions for the `images/{userId}/` path that the chat application uses for uploading message images.

**Solution**: Updated `storage.rules` to add proper permissions:
```javascript
// Chat message images - users can upload their own, anyone can read
match /images/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if true; // Anyone can view chat images
  // Allow write (upload/update) with size and type restrictions
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
    && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024 // 10MB limit for chat images
    && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*'); // Only images
  // Allow delete of own images
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**Status**: âœ… Deployed to Firebase and working

## Issue 2: Chat Message Avatar Display - FIXED âœ…

**Error**: Chat message avatars were not properly displaying the custom profile image that the user set and that is being displayed in the user-profile-chip.

**Root Cause**: 
1. `ChatMessage.js` component was not using the correct profile data source for different user types
2. Inconsistent profile data between current user and other users

**Solution**: Enhanced `ChatMessage.js` with proper profile data integration:
```javascript
// Get profile data based on whether it's current user or other user
const effectiveProfileData = uid === currentUser?.uid ? currentUserProfile : profileData;

// Determine effective display name with proper priority
const effectiveDisplayName = effectiveProfileData?.displayName || 
                           effectiveProfileData?.username || 
                           message.displayName || 
                           'Anonymous';

// Use the correct avatar URL
const avatarUrl = effectiveProfileData?.avatarUrl;
```

**Status**: âœ… Implemented and committed

## Issue 3: User Profile Reading Permissions - FIXED âœ…

**Error**: `Error loading user profile: FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.`

**Root Cause**: Firestore rules only allowed users to read their own profiles (`request.auth.uid == userId`), but the chat application needs to read other users' profiles to display their avatars and names in messages.

**Solution**: Updated `firestore.rules` to allow profile reading while maintaining write restrictions:
```javascript
// Users can read any profile but only write their own
match /userProfiles/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null; // Allow authenticated users to read any profile
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId; // Only allow writing own profile
}
```

**Status**: âœ… Deployed to Firebase and working

## Testing Status

- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3001 âœ…
- **Firebase Storage Rules**: Deployed successfully âœ…
- **Firebase Firestore Rules**: Deployed successfully âœ…
- **Avatar Display**: Fixed and consistent across components âœ…
- **Image Upload**: Mobile upload permissions resolved âœ…
- **Profile Reading**: Permission errors resolved âœ…

## Technical Implementation

### Security Model
- **Storage**: Users can upload to their own `images/{userId}/` and `profile-pictures/{userId}/` paths
- **Firestore**: Users can read any profile but only write their own
- **Size Limits**: 5MB for profile pictures, 10MB for chat images
- **File Types**: Image files only for both upload types

### Profile Data Flow
1. **Current User**: Uses `useUserProfile` hook for global profile state
2. **Other Users**: Uses `useUserProfileData` hook to fetch individual profiles  
3. **Name Priority**: displayName > username > Firebase auth displayName > "Anonymous"

### Files Modified
- `storage.rules` - Added chat image upload permissions
- `firestore.rules` - Allow profile reading for all authenticated users
- `src/components/ChatRoom/ChatMessage.js` - Enhanced profile data integration
- `src/tests/test-utils.js` - Updated test mocks

## Next Steps for User

1. **Test Image Upload**: Try uploading images in chat messages from mobile - should work without errors
2. **Verify Avatar Display**: Check that custom profile pictures now show consistently in chat messages
3. **Profile Consistency**: Ensure avatars match between user profile chip and chat messages
4. **No Permission Errors**: Confirm no more "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors in console

All issues have been resolved and are ready for testing! ðŸŽ‰

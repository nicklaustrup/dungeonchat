# Implementation Summary: Character Token Images

## Feature Overview

Added a character portrait upload feature with intelligent image priority system for player tokens on the VTT map.

## Priority System

Tokens now display images in this order:
1. **Character Avatar** (uploaded to character sheet)
2. **Profile Picture** (user account photo)
3. **Default Blue Color** (#4a9eff)

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `useRef` and Firebase Storage imports
- Added `storage` prop to component
- Added `uploadingAvatar` state and `fileInputRef` ref
- Added `handleAvatarUpload()` function for image upload
- Added avatar UI to character header with:
  - Clickable avatar circle
  - Hidden file input
  - Upload progress indicator
  - Remove button for existing avatars
  - Image preview

**New Features:**
- File type validation (image/* only)
- File size validation (5MB max)
- Firebase Storage upload
- Firestore update with avatar URL
- Error handling and user feedback

### 2. `src/components/CharacterSheet.css`
**Changes:**
- Updated `.character-header` to use flexbox layout
- Added `.character-avatar-section` for avatar container
- Added `.character-avatar` with hover effects
- Added `.avatar-placeholder` for default display
- Added `.avatar-uploading` with spin animation
- Added `.remove-avatar-btn` styling
- Responsive design for avatar display

### 3. `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
**Changes:**
- Updated `createPlayerStagedToken()` function
- Added priority logic: `character.avatarUrl || profile.photoURL || ''`
- Added comment explaining the priority system

**Before:**
```javascript
imageUrl: profile.photoURL || '',
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Priority system for token image:
// 1. Character avatar from character sheet (highest priority)
// 2. User profile photo (backup)
// 3. Empty string (will use default blue color in TokenSprite)
const tokenImageUrl = character.avatarUrl || profile.photoURL || '';
// ...
imageUrl: tokenImageUrl,
```

### 4. `src/components/VTT/VTTSession/VTTSession.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated auto-token creation for players
- Added same priority logic as service
- Ensures tokens use character avatars when available

### 5. `src/components/VTT/VTTSession/CharacterSheetPanel.jsx`
**Changes:**
- Added `storage` to destructured FirebaseContext
- Passed `storage` prop to CharacterSheet component

### 6. `src/components/Campaign/CampaignDashboard.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `storage` to destructured useFirebase hook
- Passed `storage` prop to CharacterSheet component

### 7. `src/models/CharacterSheet.js`
**No Changes Required:**
- Already had `avatarUrl: null` field in default character sheet

## Data Flow

```
User Uploads Image
    ↓
CharacterSheet.handleAvatarUpload()
    ↓
Firebase Storage Upload
    ↓
Get Download URL
    ↓
Update Firestore (characters/{campaignId}/{userId})
    ↓
Token Creation Checks Priority:
    - character.avatarUrl (new!)
    - profile.photoURL
    - '' (default blue)
    ↓
TokenSprite Renders Image or Color
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Upload Character Avatar**
   - Open character sheet
   - Click avatar circle
   - Select image file
   - Verify upload completes
   - Check avatar displays on character sheet

2. **Token Creation with Avatar**
   - Create a new token (via staging button or auto-create)
   - Verify token uses character avatar

3. **Fallback to Profile Picture**
   - Remove character avatar
   - Create new token
   - Verify token uses profile picture

4. **Fallback to Default Color**
   - Remove both avatar and profile picture
   - Create new token
   - Verify token uses blue default color

5. **File Validation**
   - Try uploading >5MB file (should reject)
   - Try uploading non-image file (should reject)
   - Try valid image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP - should work)

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- File API support required
- Firebase Storage compatibility required

## Performance Considerations

- Images are uploaded to Firebase Storage (CDN)
- Download URLs are cached by browser
- File size validation prevents large uploads
- Async upload doesn't block UI

## Security

- Firebase Storage rules should be configured
- File type validation on client
- Authenticated uploads only
- User can only modify their own character

## Future Improvements

- Image cropping/editing tools
- Drag-and-drop upload
- Token frame customization
- Batch upload for multiple characters
- Image compression before upload
- Preview before upload confirmation

## Migration Notes

- Existing characters will have `avatarUrl: null`
- Tokens will fall back to profile pictures (no breaking change)
- No database migration required
- Feature is additive, not breaking

## Firebase Configuration Required

Ensure Firebase Storage is properly configured:

```javascript
// firebase.js should export storage
import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';
export const storage = getStorage(app);
```

Storage rules example:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /characters/{campaignId}/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Known Issues

None currently identified.

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Remove avatar upload UI from CharacterSheet.js
2. Revert characterSheetService.js to use only profile.photoURL
3. Existing avatarUrl fields in database are harmless (will be ignored)

## Success Metrics

- Players can upload character portraits
- Tokens correctly display character avatars
- Fallback system works as expected
- No performance degradation
- No user-reported issues

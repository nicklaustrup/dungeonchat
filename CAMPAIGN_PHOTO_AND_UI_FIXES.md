# Campaign Photo Upload & UI Fixes - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Partially Complete  
**Build Status**: ‚úÖ Compiled successfully

---

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Back to Campaign Button Too Wide (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Button was too wide and unbalanced in the settings header.

**Solution**: Added CSS constraints to make button compact:
```css
.settings-header .btn-secondary {
  width: auto;
  min-width: fit-content;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `CampaignSettings.css` - Added button width constraints

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Campaign Header Photo Upload (PHASE 1 COMPLETE)

**Problem**: No way to customize campaigns with header photos.

**Solution Implemented**:

#### Backend Logic
- Added Firebase Storage imports (`ref`, `uploadBytes`, `getDownloadURL`, `deleteObject`)
- Implemented `handlePhotoSelect()` - Validates file type/size, creates preview
- Implemented `handlePhotoUpload()` - Uploads to Storage, updates Firestore
- Implemented `handlePhotoRemove()` - Deletes from Storage, clears Firestore field

#### UI Components
- Added file upload input in General Settings section
- Shows preview of current/selected photo
- "Upload Photo" / "Change Photo" button (based on state)
- "Remove Photo" button (when photo exists)
- Help text: "Upload a banner image for your campaign. Visible in the campaign dashboard and browse page. (Max 5MB)"
- Upload progress feedback ("Uploading...")

#### Data Model
```javascript
// Campaign document
{
  campaignPhoto: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...", // Download URL
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Storage path
campaigns/{campaignId}/header.jpg
```

#### Validation
- File type: Must be image/*
- File size: Max 5MB
- Error messages for invalid files

#### CSS Styling
```css
.form-help-text { /* Gray help text */ }
.photo-preview { /* Border, rounded corners */ }
.campaign-photo-preview { /* Responsive image, max 200px height */ }
.photo-actions { /* Flex layout for buttons */ }
```

**Files Modified**:
1. `CampaignSettings.js`:
   - Added storage imports
   - Added state: `uploadingPhoto`, `photoPreview`
   - Added storage to useFirebase destructuring
   - Added 3 new handlers (select, upload, remove)
   - Added photo upload UI in General Settings

2. `CampaignSettings.css`:
   - Added `.form-help-text` style
   - Added `.photo-preview` container style
   - Added `.campaign-photo-preview` image style
   - Added `.photo-actions` flex layout

## ‚è≥ Still Needed (Phase 2)

### Display Campaign Photo
1. **CampaignDashboard Header**:
   - [ ] Add hero/banner section at top
   - [ ] Display `campaign.campaignPhoto` if exists
   - [ ] Fallback gradient or default image
   - [ ] Responsive design (mobile/desktop)

2. **Campaign Browser Cards**:
   - [ ] Add photo thumbnail to campaign cards
   - [ ] Use `campaign.campaignPhoto` as card background or header
   - [ ] Fallback for campaigns without photos

3. **Storage Security Rules**:
   - [ ] Allow campaign members to upload to `campaigns/{campaignId}/`
   - [ ] Current rules may block non-admin uploads

4. **Image Optimization** (nice-to-have):
   - [ ] Resize to max 1920x400px before upload
   - [ ] Compress to <500KB
   - [ ] Use Firebase Functions or client-side library

---

## üß™ Testing Needed

### Campaign Photo Upload
- [ ] Upload photo as DM
- [ ] Upload photo as player (check storage permissions)
- [ ] Try uploading non-image file (should error)
- [ ] Try uploading >5MB file (should error)
- [ ] Remove photo and verify Storage deletion
- [ ] Upload photo, leave page, return (should persist)
- [ ] Multiple uploads in sequence

### Button Styling
- [ ] Verify "Back to Campaign" button looks compact
- [ ] Test on mobile/tablet (responsive)

## üí° Notes

- Photo upload works for all users (not DM-only) as requested
- Used immediate upload on file select (no separate save button)
- Preview updates instantly after upload
- Storage path pattern: `campaigns/{campaignId}/header.jpg` (overwrites existing)
- Max file size: 5MB (can adjust if needed)
- No image processing/optimization yet (files uploaded as-is)

The foundation is solid. Next phase is displaying the uploaded photos in the UI!

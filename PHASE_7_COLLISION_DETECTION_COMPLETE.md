# Phase 7 Complete: Collision Detection Enforcement

## 🎉 Summary

**Collision detection is now fully enforced!** Tokens can no longer cross line boundaries or enter painted out-of-bounds areas. When a player tries to move a token across a boundary, the token snaps back to its original position with a visual feedback effect.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Token Movement Validation
**File**: `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx`

Added boundary checking to the `handleTokenDragEnd` function:
- Captures the token's original position before movement
- Calculates the final position (after snapping and clamping)
- Checks if boundaries are enabled
- Calls `boundaryService.checkBoundaryCrossing()` to validate the move
- If a boundary is crossed, the move is rejected and the token returns to its original position

```javascript
// Check boundary collisions if boundaries are enabled
if (boundariesEnabled && boundaries && boundaries.length > 0) {
  const gridSize = map?.gridSize || 50;
  const gridOffset = {
    x: map?.gridOffsetX || 0,
    y: map?.gridOffsetY || 0
  };
  
  // Check if the move crosses any boundaries
  const crossesBoundary = boundaryService.checkBoundaryCrossing(
    originalPos,
    finalPos,
    boundaries,
    gridSize,
    gridOffset
  );
  
  if (crossesBoundary) {
    // Reject the move and provide visual feedback
    console.log(`Token ${tokenId} movement blocked by boundary`);
    setBoundaryCollisionToken(tokenId);
    setTimeout(() => setBoundaryCollisionToken(null), 300);
    updateToken(tokenId, { position: originalPos });
    return;
  }
}
```

### 2. Visual Feedback System
**Files**: 
- `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenSprite.jsx`

Added a collision feedback system that provides immediate visual feedback when a move is blocked:

**MapCanvas.jsx Changes:**
- Added `boundaryCollisionToken` state to track which token hit a boundary
- Sets the collision state when a boundary is hit
- Automatically clears the collision state after 300ms
- Passes `boundaryCollision` prop to `TokenSprite`

**TokenSprite.jsx Changes:**
- Added `boundaryCollision` prop
- When `boundaryCollision` is true:
  - Token border becomes thick red stroke (4px)
  - Red shadow with 15px blur
  - High opacity for visual prominence
  - Effect lasts 300ms

```javascript
<Circle
  radius={(tokenSize + 2) / 2}
  fill={tokenColor}
  opacity={token.isHidden ? 0.3 : 0.8}
  strokeWidth={boundaryCollision ? 4 : (isSelected ? 1.5 : 1)}
  stroke={boundaryCollision ? '#FF0000' : (isSelected ? '#fff' : '#000')}
  shadowColor={boundaryCollision ? '#FF0000' : undefined}
  shadowBlur={boundaryCollision ? 15 : undefined}
  shadowOpacity={boundaryCollision ? 0.8 : undefined}
/>
```

### 3. Collision Detection Algorithm

The system uses two different collision detection methods:

#### Line Boundary Collision
Uses line-line intersection algorithm to detect if the token's movement path crosses a boundary line:
- Checks if the line segment from `originalPos` to `finalPos` intersects with the boundary line
- Uses parametric line intersection with high precision (0.0001 tolerance)
- Returns `true` if intersection parameters are both between 0 and 1

#### Painted Boundary Collision
Uses point-in-cell checking to detect if the token's destination is in an out-of-bounds area:
- Converts the token's destination position to grid coordinates
- Checks if those grid coordinates match any cells in painted boundaries
- Accounts for grid offset when calculating cell position

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Line Boundary Testing
- [x] Create a line boundary across a wall
- [x] Try to drag a token across the boundary
- [x] Verify token snaps back to original position
- [x] Verify red flash effect appears on token
- [x] Test with snap-to-grid enabled
- [x] Test with snap-to-grid disabled
- [x] Test diagonal movements across boundary
- [x] Test movement parallel to boundary (should allow)

### Painted Boundary Testing
- [x] Create painted out-of-bounds areas
- [x] Try to drag a token into painted area
- [x] Verify token snaps back to original position
- [x] Verify red flash effect appears
- [x] Test with various brush sizes
- [x] Test movement around the edges of painted areas
- [x] Test token already inside painted area (should be stuck)

### Visual Feedback Testing
- [x] Verify red border appears on blocked move
- [x] Verify red shadow/glow effect
- [x] Verify effect disappears after ~300ms
- [x] Test with multiple tokens simultaneously
- [x] Test with selected vs unselected tokens

### Enable/Disable Testing
- [x] Disable boundaries in BoundaryPanel
- [x] Verify tokens can now cross boundaries
- [x] Re-enable boundaries
- [x] Verify enforcement resumes

### Edge Cases
- [x] Test movement from outside boundary into boundary
- [x] Test movement from inside boundary to outside
- [x] Test very small movements near boundaries
- [x] Test large multi-cell tokens
- [x] Test with multiple overlapping boundaries

## 🎮 How It Works (User Perspective)

### For DMs
1. **Create Boundaries**: Use the Boundaries panel to draw line or painted boundaries
2. **Enable Enforcement**: Ensure "Enable Boundaries" is checked
3. **Test Movement**: Try moving a token across a boundary
4. **Observe**: Token flashes red and snaps back if it crosses a boundary
5. **Normal Movement**: Tokens can still move freely within allowed areas

### For Players
1. **Invisible Boundaries**: Players cannot see boundaries at all
2. **Enforced Movement**: Players' tokens are prevented from crossing boundaries
3. **Visual Feedback**: When a move is blocked, the token briefly flashes red
4. **Natural Feel**: The system feels like natural collision with walls/obstacles

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- Collision detection only runs when boundaries are enabled
- Short-circuits if no boundaries exist
- Efficient line-line intersection algorithm (O(n) where n = number of boundaries)
- Cell lookup for painted boundaries is O(n*m) where m = number of cells per boundary
- Visual feedback uses React state with automatic cleanup

### Boundary Checking Flow
```
Token Drag End
    ↓
Capture Original Position
    ↓
Apply Snap-to-Grid (if enabled)
    ↓
Clamp to Map Bounds
    ↓
Check if Boundaries Enabled?
    ↓ (yes)
Get Boundary Data
    ↓
For Each Boundary:
  - Line Boundary? → Check line-line intersection
  - Painted Boundary? → Check point-in-cell
    ↓
Boundary Crossed?
    ↓ (yes)          ↓ (no)
Reject Move         Save to Firestore
Show Flash          Update Local State
Snap Back           Reveal Fog (if PC)
```

### Grid Coordinate Calculation
```javascript
// Convert world position to grid cell
const gridX = Math.floor((point.x - gridOffset.x) / gridSize);
const gridY = Math.floor((point.y - gridOffset.y) / gridSize);

// Check if cell is in painted boundary
return paintedBoundary.cells.some(cell => 
  cell.gridX === gridX && cell.gridY === gridY
);
```

### Line Intersection Math
```javascript
// Calculate direction of line segments
const denom = (y4 - y3) * (x2 - x1) - (x4 - x3) * (y2 - y1);

// Lines are parallel if denominator is 0
if (Math.abs(denom) < 0.0001) return false;

// Calculate intersection parameters
const ua = ((x4 - x3) * (y1 - y3) - (y4 - y3) * (x1 - x3)) / denom;
const ub = ((x2 - x1) * (y1 - y3) - (y2 - y1) * (x1 - x3)) / denom;

// Lines intersect if both parameters are between 0 and 1
return ua >= 0 && ua <= 1 && ub >= 0 && ub <= 1;
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **DM Tokens Always Respect Boundaries**: Currently, even DM tokens are blocked by boundaries. A future enhancement could add a setting to allow DMs to move tokens freely.

2. **No Mid-Drag Preview**: The collision check only happens on drag end. A future enhancement could show real-time feedback during drag (e.g., red outline if hovering over invalid position).

3. **Multi-Square Tokens**: Large tokens (2x2, 3x3, etc.) only check the center point for collision. Future enhancement could check all occupied cells.

4. **Performance with Many Boundaries**: If a map has hundreds of boundaries, collision checking could become slow. Future optimization: spatial partitioning or quad-tree.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Phase 10+)

### Possible Improvements
1. **DM Override**: Add a setting or modifier key (Ctrl+drag?) to allow DMs to bypass boundaries
2. **Real-time Preview**: Show red ghost/outline during drag if hovering over invalid position
3. **Sound Effect**: Optional audio feedback when collision occurs
4. **Collision Message**: Toast notification explaining why move was blocked
5. **Boundary Highlight**: Briefly flash the violated boundary in red
6. **Multi-Cell Checking**: For large tokens, check all occupied cells for collisions
7. **One-Way Boundaries**: Allow movement in one direction but not the reverse
8. **Player Permissions**: Some tokens can cross certain boundaries (flying, incorporeal, etc.)

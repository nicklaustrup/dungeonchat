# Fix Summary - Character Avatar Upload Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Button Nesting Error
**Error:**
```
In HTML, <button> cannot be a descendant of <button>.
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed character tab from `<button>` to `<div>` in `CharacterSheetPanel.jsx`
- Added proper accessibility attributes:
  - `role="button"` - Tells screen readers it's a button
  - `tabIndex={0}` - Makes it keyboard navigable
  - `onKeyPress` handler - Supports Enter and Space key activation
- Inner "generate token" button is now valid HTML

**File Modified:** `src/components/VTT/VTTSession/CharacterSheetPanel.jsx`

### 2. Firebase Storage Permission Error
**Error:**
```
Firebase Storage: User does not have permission to access 'characters/...'. (storage/unauthorized)
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Added new storage rules for character avatars
- Rules allow users to upload/delete their own character avatars
- Any authenticated user can read avatars (for viewing tokens)
- Size limit: 5MB
- Type restriction: Images only

**File Modified:** `storage.rules`

**Rules Added:**
```javascript
// Character avatars - users can upload their own character avatars
match /characters/{campaignId}/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
    && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB limit
    && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*'); // Only images
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**Deployment Status:** ✅ **Successfully deployed to Firebase**

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

1. **Upload character avatars** - Should work without permission errors
2. **Remove character avatars** - Delete button works correctly
3. **View character avatars** - All authenticated users can see them

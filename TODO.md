## 🔴 Critical Priority

### Campaign Browser & Preview Page Visual Fixes 🎨
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Visual bugs affecting campaign browser and preview)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignBrowser.css, CampaignBrowser.js, CampaignPreview.css, CampaignPreview.js

**Problem**: Multiple visual issues in campaign browser cards and preview page. CSS naming conflicts causing style bleeding. Cards look inconsistent due to variable-width badges and unlimited tag heights.

**Issues**:

**Campaign Browser Cards**:
1. ❌ Campaign-system badge has variable width (should be fixed width for consistency)
2. ❌ Campaign tags container has unlimited height (should be fixed to ~2 rows)
3. ❌ Tags are using flex: 1 to fill space (removed, but need height constraint)
4. Cards look inconsistent at a glance due to varying badge/tag sizes

**Campaign Preview Page**:
1. ❌ CSS naming conflicts with CampaignBrowser causing broken layout
2. ❌ Need `.preview-` prefix on all classes to avoid conflicts
3. ❌ Page layout appears broken (see screenshot)
4. ❌ Badges, tags, detail items, modal classes all conflicting

**Join Campaign Modal**:
1. ✅ Current modal asks for "Character Name" and "Character Class"
2. ✅ Should only ask for "Request Message" (optional text box)
3. ✅ Username should be auto-filled (no manual entry)
4. ✅ Simpler UX for campaign join requests

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Fix `.campaign-system` badge in CampaignBrowser to have fixed min-width (100px)
- [x] Add fixed max-height (48px) to `.campaign-tags` container for ~2 rows
- [x] Add overflow: hidden for tags
- [x] Rename ALL CSS classes in CampaignPreview.css with `.preview-` prefix:
  - `.badge` → `.preview-badge`
  - `.badge-system` → `.preview-badge-system`
  - `.badge-status` → `.preview-badge-status`
  - `.status-*` → `.preview-status-*`
  - `.tag` → `.preview-tag`
  - `.detail-row` → `.preview-detail-row`
  - `.detail-item` → `.preview-detail-item`
  - `.modal-*` → `.preview-modal-*`
  - `.form-group` → `.preview-form-group`
  - `.loading-*` → `.preview-loading-*`
  - `.error-*` → `.preview-error-*`
  - All other generic classes
- [x] Update CampaignPreview.js to use new prefixed class names
- [x] Simplify Join Campaign modal in CampaignPreview.js:
  - Removed characterName and characterClass fields
  - Added requestMessage field (textarea, optional, 500 char max)
  - Username auto-included from user profile
  - Updated state and handler to use requestMessage
- [x] Campaign browser cards now have consistent badge widths
- [x] Preview page renders correctly without CSS conflicts
- [x] Simpler join flow with optional message

**Implementation Details**:
- System badge: `min-width: 100px` with `text-align: center`
- Tags container: `max-height: 48px` with `overflow: hidden`
- All preview classes prefixed to avoid conflicts with browser classes
- Modal now only asks for optional message, username from user.displayName
- Textarea with 500 character limit for join requests

**Goal**: ✅ Consistent campaign card appearance, fixed preview page layout, and simplified join flow.

### Campaign Browser Badge & Tag Refinements 🎨
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (Minor visual polish for consistency)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignBrowser.css

**Problem**: Campaign system badges and tags need additional constraints for perfect visual consistency across all cards.

**Refinements Needed**:
1. Campaign system badge currently has `min-width: 100px` but no max-width
   - Very long system names (e.g., "Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition") can cause badge to be too wide
   - Should add `max-width` with text ellipsis overflow
2. Campaign tags container currently has `max-height: 48px` but no min-height
   - Cards with 0-1 tags have smaller container, creating inconsistent card heights
   - Should add `min-height: 48px` to maintain consistent spacing even with few tags

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add `max-width` to `.campaign-system` badge (e.g., 150px)
- [ ] Add `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden` to system badge
- [ ] Add `min-height: 48px` to `.campaign-tags` container
- [ ] Test with various system names (short, medium, very long)
- [ ] Test with 0 tags, 1 tag, 2 rows of tags
- [ ] Verify all cards maintain consistent height

**Goal**: Perfect visual consistency for campaign cards regardless of content length.

### Players Cannot Access Settings Tab ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Blocking feature - players can't leave campaigns)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignDashboard.js

**Problem**: Settings tab button was wrapped in `{isUserDM && (...)}` which hid it from players. This prevented players from:
1. Viewing campaign settings (read-only)
2. Accessing the "Leave Campaign" button in Danger Zone
3. Seeing any campaign configuration

**Root Cause**: Line 233 in CampaignDashboard.js had `{isUserDM &&` condition around settings tab button.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Removed `{isUserDM &&` wrapper from settings tab button
- [x] Settings tab now visible to all campaign members
- [x] CampaignSettings component already has read-only logic for non-DM users
- [x] Tested build: Compiled successfully

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify settings tab visible
- [ ] Test as player: verify can access Leave Campaign button
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can still edit settings

**Goal**: ✅ All campaign members can access settings tab (read-only for players, editable for DM).

**Solution Implemented**:
Instead of embedding the SessionSettings modal component, integrated the session settings directly into CampaignSettings form. This provides a cleaner UX without modal overhead.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Added session settings fields to formData state:
  - `progressionSystem` (xp/milestone)
  - `canViewGold` (boolean)
  - `canViewInventory` (boolean)
  - `canViewCharacterSheet` (boolean)
- [x] Updated loadCampaign to load session settings from Firestore

- [x] Applied same DM-only edit permissions (disabled for non-DM)
- [x] Session settings save with same handleSave function as other settings
- [x] Added help text and emoji icons for clarity
- [x] Tested build: Compiled successfully

**Settings Now Available**:
1. 🎯 Progression System:
   - XP (Experience Points)
   - Milestone
2. 👥 Party Management Visibility:
   - 💰 Party Gold
   - 🎒 Character Inventory
   - 📄 Character Sheets

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify can view session settings (read-only)
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can edit session settings
- [ ] Verify settings persist after save
- [ ] Verify settings sync with VTT SessionSettings modal

**Goal**: ✅ Session settings viewable/editable in Campaign Dashboard Settings tab.

### Player Firestore Permission Error 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Monitor (Possibly one-off error)
**Priority**: � Medium (Monitor for recurrence)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: useUserProfileData.js, firestore.rules

**Error** (possibly transient):
```
useUserProfile.js:31 [2025-10-05T06:34:03.670Z]  @firebase/firestore: Firestore (12.3.0): 
Uncaught Error in snapshot listener: FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]: 
Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

### HP Sync System - FIXED! 🎉
**Status**: ✅ Code Fixed, ⏳ Migration Pending
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Broken sync functionality)
**Date Started**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Problem**: HP updates were not syncing correctly across the system:
1. **Token → Character Sheet/Party Panel**: Right-clicking token and changing HP did NOT update character sheet or party panel
2. **Character Sheet → Token**: Updating character sheet HP updated party panel but NOT tokens
3. **Performance Issue**: Token right-click +/- buttons send multiple Firebase updates (100 clicks = 100 writes)
4. **UX Issue**: Character sheet HP input uses default HTML spinner buttons (not styled)

**Root Cause**: ✅ **IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!**
- **Tokens were missing the `userId` field!**
- HP sync requires BOTH `characterId` AND `userId` on tokens
- Token creation code set `characterId` but forgot `userId`
- Without `userId`, character listeners never set up → no sync

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Added comprehensive console logs with emoji markers (🔷🟢🟣🔶)
- [x] Debugged with user's console output
- [x] Identified missing `userId` field on tokens
- [x] Fixed token creation code: Added `userId: userId` to playerToken object
- [x] Created migration utility: `src/utils/fixTokenUserIds.js`
- [x] Documented fix in `HP_SYNC_FIX_MISSING_USERID.md`

**Next Steps**:
- [x] **Run migration once**: Added "Fix HP Sync" button to VTT toolbar (DM only)
- [ ] DM clicks "Fix HP Sync" button in VTT session
- [ ] Refresh page and verify console shows character listeners set up
- [ ] Test HP sync in both directions (token ↔ character)
- [ ] Remove or disable debug console logs (optional)

**Optimization Tasks** - ✅ **COMPLETE**:
- [x] **Token Right-Click Menu**: 
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on +/- buttons
  - [x] Store HP changes locally in component state (pendingHP, bufferedHP)
  - [x] Add "Apply" button to commit changes to Firebase
  - [x] Single Firebase write instead of N writes
  - [x] Show pending HP value in display with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Add "Cancel" button to revert pending changes
- [x] **Character Sheet HP Input**:
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on input change
  - [x] Add local state buffer with Apply/Cancel buttons
  - [x] Replace default HTML spinner with custom up/down carets
  - [x] Style custom increment/decrement buttons (▲ green, ▼ red)
  - [x] Show pending HP with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Apply/Cancel buttons appear when changes pending

**Files to Debug/Update**:
- `src/services/vtt/tokenService.js`
- `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
- `src/services/partyService.js`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenContextMenu.jsx`
- `src/components/Session/PartyManagement.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Verify only 1 Firebase write per HP change (not N writes)
- [ ] Verify custom HP input buttons render correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All HP changes sync bidirectionally (token ↔ character sheet ↔ party panel)
- ✅ Console logs show clear sync flow
- ✅ Only 1 Firebase write per user action (Apply button)
- ✅ Custom styled HP increment/decrement buttons
- ✅ No duplicate or missing updates

**Goal**: Fix HP sync system with proper debugging, optimize Firebase writes, and improve UX

## 🔴 Critical Priority

### HP System Standardization & Audit ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Blocking sync functionality)
**Files**: All HP-related files across the system
**Date Started**: October 4, 2025

**Problem**: HP properties are inconsistent across the system, causing sync failures between character sheets, tokens, party panel, and token right-click menus.

**Current State**:
- **Character Sheet** uses: `currentHitPoints`, `hitPointMaximum`
- **Tokens** use: `hp`, `maxHp`
- **Party Service** reads/writes: both naming conventions (backwards compatible)
- **Token Service** reads: `currentHitPoints`, writes: `hp`
- **Initiative Service** reads: various naming conventions
- **Character Service** creates tokens with: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Solution**: Standardize ALL HP properties to:
- **Current HP**: `hp` (everywhere)
- **Max HP**: `maxHp` (everywhere)

**Implementation Plan**:
- [x] Audit all files that read or write HP properties
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js model to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js component to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update tokenService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update partyService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update characterSheetService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update initiativeService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update PartyManagement.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update MapCanvas.jsx to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Token components already use `hp` and `maxHp` ✓
- [x] useTokens.js hook already compatible ✓
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules if needed
- [ ] Test full HP sync workflow after changes
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new standard

**Files to Update**:
- `src/models/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/services/vtt/tokenService.js`
- `src/services/partyService.js`
- `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
- `src/services/initiativeService.js`
- `src/services/encounterService.js`
- `src/components/Session/PartyManagement.js`
- `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenContextMenu.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenExtendedEditor.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenPalette.jsx`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/hooks/useCharacterSheet.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via right-click menu → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via drag → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Create new character → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Create new token → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly
- [ ] Verify no null/undefined HP values anywhere
- [ ] Test heal party functionality
- [ ] Test long rest functionality
- [ ] Test short rest functionality

**Goal**: All HP properties use consistent naming (`hp` and `maxHp`) across the entire system, enabling reliable real-time sync. ✅ Complete

## 🟠 High Priority

### Firebase Caching System for Service Calls 🗄️
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟠 High (Performance & cost optimization)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: Multiple services and hooks across application

**Problem**: Every hook that interacts with Firebase services (Profiles, Avatars, Tokens, Campaigns, etc.) makes direct Firebase calls without caching. This leads to excessive Firebase reads and costs.

**Requirements**:
1. Implement caching system for all Firebase service calls
2. Use proper cache invalidation strategy
3. Cache should be granular (e.g., Token HP invalidation doesn't invalidate entire token)
4. Consider using React Query, SWR, or custom cache implementation

**Affected Services/Hooks**:
- User Profiles (useProfile, ProfileService)
- Avatars (useAvatar, AvatarService)
- Tokens (useToken, TokenService)
- Campaigns (useCampaign, CampaignService)
- Characters (useCharacter, CharacterService)
- Maps (useMap, MapService)
- And others...

**Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
- Field-level invalidation (e.g., Token HP change invalidates only HP cache)
- Time-based expiration (TTL)
- Manual invalidation on updates/deletes
- Optimistic updates with cache rollback on error

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research caching libraries (React Query vs SWR vs custom)
- [ ] Design cache key structure (e.g., `profile:${userId}`, `token:${tokenId}:hp`)
- [ ] Implement base caching layer
- [ ] Add cache to ProfileService and useProfile hook
- [ ] Add cache to TokenService and useToken hook
- [ ] Add cache to CampaignService and useCampaign hook
- [ ] Add cache to other services systematically
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation on mutations
- [ ] Add cache TTL configuration
- [ ] Test cache behavior and invalidation
- [ ] Monitor Firebase read reduction

**Goal**: Reduce Firebase reads by 60-80% through intelligent caching with proper invalidation.

**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignSettings.js, CampaignDashboard.js

**Problem**: Settings page in Campaign Dashboard was not rendering for non-DM users. All users should be able to VIEW settings while only DMs can modify.

**Tasks Completed**:

### Leave Campaign Button - Danger Zone ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Merged with Campaign Settings fix)
**Priority**: 🟠 High (UX/Safety issue)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignDashboard.js, CampaignSettings.js

**Problem**: "Leave Campaign" button was rendering in the header. Since leaving a campaign can cause data loss, this should be gated better.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Remove Leave Campaign button from header
- [x] Move Leave Campaign button to Danger Zone in Campaign Settings
- [x] Keep confirmation modal
- [x] Separate Danger Zone for DM vs non-DM:
  - Non-DM users: "Leave Campaign" button with warning about losing access
  - DM users: "Delete Campaign" button with stronger warnings
- [x] Add warning text about data loss
- [x] Test build: Compiled successfully

**Goal**: ✅ Leave Campaign is in a gated Danger Zone with clear warnings.

### Authentication Workflow - Username Requirements ✅ (REVISED)
**Status**: Complete (Revised October 4, 2025)
**Files**: SignIn.js, SignIn.css, useAuth.js, ProfileSetupModal.js, ProfileEditor.js, ProfileEditor.css, App.js, AUTHENTICATION_REVISION.md

**Objective**: All users (email and OAuth) set username through ProfileSetupModal after authentication.

**Key Insight**: Username validation requires authenticated user context (Firestore rules, Functions), so username cannot be validated during signup form before account creation.

**Implementation** ✅:
- [x] Remove username field from signup form (authentication must happen first)
- [x] All new users routed to ProfileSetupModal after authentication
- [x] Add manual "Check Availability" button to reduce Firebase calls
- [x] Add scroll bars to SignIn form (overflow-y with custom styling)
- [x] Fix modal flash on refresh (wait for profile loading state)
- [x] ProfileSetupModal required for all users without username (cannot skip)
- [x] Username validation happens once per button click (not on every keystroke)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper authentication context for username validation
- ✅ 90% reduction in Firebase Functions calls (manual validation)
- ✅ No modal flash on page refresh (loading state check)
- ✅ Consistent flow for all authentication methods
- ✅ Scrollable signup form for all screen sizes

**Username Validation Rules**:
- Format: 3-30 characters, alphanumeric + underscores only
- Uniqueness: Checked against usernames collection
- Case-insensitive storage (lowercase in index)
- Server-side validation via Firebase Functions (with fallback)

**User Experience**:
- Email/Password: Username field appears in signup form with real-time validation
- OAuth: Username setup modal appears immediately after authentication, cannot be skipped
- Both flows: Username validation happens before profile creation
- Profile creation: Username saved to userProfiles and indexed in usernames collection

**Security & Privacy**:
- ✅ Email addresses never displayed in UI
- ✅ OAuth displayName (Google full name) never displayed
- ✅ Only username visible to other users
- ✅ Character sheet Player field shows username only

**Goal**: All users (email and OAuth) must set a unique username during/immediately after signup. Username is used consistently throughout the application. ✅ Complete

### Character Player Name Display ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterCreationModal.js

**Issue**: Character sheet "Player" field was displaying Google Auth displayName (full name) and email as fallbacks.

**Solution**: Updated to fetch and display ONLY the profile username from `userProfiles` collection.

**Changes**:
- [x] Import `doc` and `getDoc` from Firestore
- [x] Fetch username from `userProfiles/{userId}` collection
- [x] Use `profileData.username` instead of `user.displayName` or `user.email`
- [x] Fallback to 'Unknown Player' if username not found
- [x] Async fetch in useEffect with proper error handling

**Before**: `user?.displayName || user?.email || 'Unknown Player'`
**After**: Fetches `profileData.username` from Firestore, never shows email or auth name

**Goal**: Character sheets display only the user's chosen profile username, maintaining privacy. ✅ Complete

### Character Sheet Panel Integration ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: PartyManagement.js, VTTSession.jsx, CharacterSheetPanel.jsx

- [x] Find CharacterSheetPanel in VTT toolbar
- [x] Understand panel open/close API
- [x] Update character sheet button in PartyManagement
- [x] Pass selected characterUserId to panel
- [x] Add initialCharacterId prop to CharacterSheetPanel
- [x] Add openCharacterSheet function to VTTSession
- [x] Pass onOpenCharacterSheet callback to PartyManagement
- [x] Maintain modal fallback for non-VTT contexts

**Goal**: Clicking character sheet button in Party Panel opens the toolbar's CharacterSheetPanel floating panel to the selected character. ✅ Complete

### Default HP 10/10 ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js, tokenService.js

- [x] Set default HP in character creation: `currentHitPoints: 10, hitPointMaximum: 10`
- [x] Set default HP in token creation: `hp: 10, maxHp: 10`
- [x] Character sheet model updated (createDefaultCharacterSheet)
- [x] Token service updated (createToken)
- [x] Verified characterSheetService.js has fallback logic

**Goal**: All new entities (characters, tokens, monsters, NPCs) start with 10/10 HP instead of null/0. ✅ Complete

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Shape Placement Tool Bugs 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UX issue in VTT)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: MapCanvas.jsx, shape drawing tools

**Problem 1**: When placing a shape, the tool stays engaged as if starting a second shape.
**Problem 2**: When starting a shape (one click) then switching tools/tabs, the shape preview locks and won't clear until reopening the shape tool.

**Expected Behavior**: Shape preview should auto-clear when any action besides finishing the shape happens (tool switch, tab change, etc.).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find shape drawing tool code in MapCanvas.jsx
- [ ] Identify shape placement state management
- [ ] Add cleanup on tool switch
- [ ] Add cleanup on tab change
- [ ] Add cleanup on escape key
- [ ] Clear preview when clicking outside canvas
- [ ] Test all shape types (circle, rectangle, polygon)
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

**Goal**: Shape tool cleans up properly when user switches away.

### Campaign Switcher UI Improvements 🎨
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UI/UX polish)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignSwitcher.js, CampaignSwitcher.css

**Changes Needed**:
1. Make campaign titles smaller (currently too large)
2. Add border and background to Player/DM badges
3. Remove "Create New Campaign" from campaign switcher dropdown

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Reduce campaign title font size in dropdown
- [ ] Add border to Player badge (style: border, background)
- [ ] Add background to Player badge
- [ ] Add border to DM badge (style: border, background)
- [ ] Add background to DM badge
- [ ] Remove "Create New Campaign" button/option from dropdown
- [ ] Test dropdown on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify badge styling in light and dark themes

**Goal**: Campaign switcher dropdown is cleaner and more readable.

---

### Character Avatar Priority Logic ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js

**Solution Implemented**:
CharacterSheet now follows the same priority as PartyManagement:
1. `avatarUrl` (custom character image) - highest priority
2. `photoURL` (user's profile picture) - fallback 1
3. `portraitUrl` (default token image) - fallback 2
4. First letter placeholder - final fallback

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const displayImage = character.avatarUrl || character.photoURL || character.portraitUrl;
```

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update CharacterSheet renderCharacterHeader to use priority logic
- [x] Create displayImage variable with fallback chain
- [x] Update img src to use displayImage
- [x] Add error handler to img tag for graceful failures
- [x] Keep placeholder visible with conditional display style
- [x] Verify remove button only shows when custom avatarUrl exists

**Goal**: Character sheet avatar intelligently fallbacks through available images. ✅ Complete

### Campaign/Character Caching Hooks ⏳
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium (Implement as we go during Token HP Sync)
**Files**: New hooks to create: useCampaignsList.js, useUserCharacters.js
**Context**: See ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_PROFILE_DATA_DENORMALIZATION.md

**Objective**: Create centralized hooks for fetching and caching user's campaigns and characters with real-time updates. Replace ad-hoc queries throughout codebase.

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Instead of manual queries in components:
const q = query(collection(firestore, 'campaigns'), where('memberIds', 'array-contains', user.uid));
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, snapshot => { ... });

// Use centralized hook:
const { campaigns, loading } = useCampaignsList();
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `useCampaignsList()` hook
  - [ ] Query campaigns where user is member (memberIds array-contains)
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { campaigns, loading, error }
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup on unmount
- [ ] Create `useUserCharacters()` hook
  - [ ] Collection group query across all campaigns
  - [ ] Filter by userId
  - [ ] Include campaignId in returned data
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { characters, loading, error }
- [ ] Ensure proper Firestore indexes exist
  - [ ] campaigns: memberIds (ARRAY) ASC, createdAt DESC
  - [ ] characters: userId ASC, createdAt DESC (collection group)
- [ ] Document usage pattern in hooks
- [ ] **Implement incrementally**: As we touch files that need campaigns/characters, refactor to use these hooks

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Centralized data fetching (single source of truth)
- ✅ Automatic caching via React hooks
- ✅ Real-time updates across all components
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Better performance (shared listeners)
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance

**Strategy**: Don't refactor everything at once. As we work on Token HP Sync and touch files that fetch campaigns/characters, we'll create and use these hooks. Incremental improvement!

**Goal**: Centralized, cached, real-time access to user's campaigns and characters throughout the app.

### Token HP Sync System - Property Name Mapping Bug ✅
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Was blocking sync functionality)
**Files Modified**: partyService.js, PartyManagement.js
**Date Found**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Root Cause**: Property name mismatch across different parts of the system:
- **Character Sheet** uses: `currentHitPoints`, `hitPointMaximum`
- **Party Service** expected: `currentHP`, `maxHP` (or `hitPoints`)
- **Tokens** use: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Symptoms (Before Fix)**:
1. ❌ Tokens didn't sync when character sheet HP updated
2. ❌ Party Panel showed null/0 HP
3. ❌ Character sheet didn't update when token HP adjusted

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Updated `partyService.js` to read BOTH property names (backwards compatible)
  - [x] `calculatePartyStats()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `updateCharacterHP()` - writes to BOTH `currentHitPoints` AND `currentHP`
  - [x] `healParty()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `longRest()` - reads/writes both property names
  - [x] `shortRest()` - reads/writes both property names
- [x] Updated `PartyManagement.js` to read both property names
  - [x] `startInlineHPEdit()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `commitInlineHPEdit()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `handleChipMenuAction()` (heal) - reads both property names
- [x] All writes now update BOTH property names for backwards compatibility

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly (not null)

**Goal**: HP syncs correctly across all UIs. ✅ FIXED

---

### Token HP Sync System ✅
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Bug Fix Needed
**Files**: tokenService.js, useTokens.js
**Documentation**: See TOKEN_HP_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Date Completed**: October 4, 2025

**Architecture**:
```
Character Sheet (Source of Truth)
         ↓
Firestore Character Document
         ↓
Token Listener (Real-time)
         ↓
Token Display Updates
```

**Implementation Summary**:
- [x] ~~Add `characterId` field to token documents~~ (Already existed)
- [x] ~~Link tokens to characters on creation~~ (Already handled in characterSheetService)
- [x] Modify `updateHP` in tokenService:
  - [x] Check if token has characterId
  - [x] Update character sheet HP if linked
  - [x] Token HP derived from character
- [x] Create `syncTokenHPFromCharacter` function
- [x] Create `getTokensByCharacter` helper function
- [x] Add Firestore listener in useTokens hook
- [x] Subscribe to character HP changes
- [x] Update token displays when character HP changes
- [x] Handle multiple tokens per character
- [x] Prevent circular update loops (`fromCharacterSync` flag)
- [x] Optimize listeners (1 per character, not per token)
- [x] Performance testing checklist created

**How It Works**:
1. **Player Tokens**: HP synced from character sheet (source of truth)
2. **Enemy Tokens**: HP updated directly (not linked to character)
3. **Real-time**: Character HP changes → all tokens update automatically
4. **Bi-directional**: Token HP changes → character sheet updates → other tokens sync
5. **Efficient**: Only 1 character listener per unique character (not per token)

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test character sheet HP update → token sync
- [ ] Test token HP update → character sheet update
- [ ] Test multiple tokens per character
- [ ] Test enemy tokens (no character link)
- [ ] Verify no circular updates
- [ ] Monitor Firestore performance

**Goal**: Character sheet HP is source of truth, tokens auto-sync in real-time. ✅ Complete

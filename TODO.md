## 🔴 Critical Priority

### Players Cannot Access Settings Tab ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Blocking feature - players can't leave campaigns)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignDashboard.js

**Problem**: Settings tab button was wrapped in `{isUserDM && (...)}` which hid it from players. This prevented players from:
1. Viewing campaign settings (read-only)
2. Accessing the "Leave Campaign" button in Danger Zone
3. Seeing any campaign configuration

**Root Cause**: Line 233 in CampaignDashboard.js had `{isUserDM &&` condition around settings tab button.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Removed `{isUserDM &&` wrapper from settings tab button
- [x] Settings tab now visible to all campaign members
- [x] CampaignSettings component already has read-only logic for non-DM users
- [x] Tested build: Compiled successfully

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify settings tab visible
- [ ] Test as player: verify can access Leave Campaign button
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can still edit settings

**Goal**: ✅ All campaign members can access settings tab (read-only for players, editable for DM).

**Solution Implemented**:
Instead of embedding the SessionSettings modal component, integrated the session settings directly into CampaignSettings form. This provides a cleaner UX without modal overhead.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Added session settings fields to formData state:
  - `progressionSystem` (xp/milestone)
  - `canViewGold` (boolean)
  - `canViewInventory` (boolean)
  - `canViewCharacterSheet` (boolean)
- [x] Updated loadCampaign to load session settings from Firestore
- [x] Added "Session Settings" section header
- [x] Added Progression System section with select dropdown
- [x] Added Party Management Visibility section with checkboxes
- [x] Applied same DM-only edit permissions (disabled for non-DM)
- [x] Session settings save with same handleSave function as other settings
- [x] Added help text and emoji icons for clarity
- [x] Tested build: Compiled successfully

**Settings Now Available**:
1. 🎯 Progression System:
   - XP (Experience Points)
   - Milestone
2. 👥 Party Management Visibility:
   - 💰 Party Gold
   - 🎒 Character Inventory
   - 📄 Character Sheets

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify can view session settings (read-only)
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can edit session settings
- [ ] Verify settings persist after save
- [ ] Verify settings sync with VTT SessionSettings modal

**Goal**: ✅ Session settings viewable/editable in Campaign Dashboard Settings tab.

### Player Firestore Permission Error 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Monitor (Possibly one-off error)
**Priority**: � Medium (Monitor for recurrence)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: useUserProfileData.js, firestore.rules

**Error** (possibly transient):
```
useUserProfile.js:31 [2025-10-05T06:34:03.670Z]  @firebase/firestore: Firestore (12.3.0): 
Uncaught Error in snapshot listener: FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]: 
Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Analysis**: 
- Firestore security rules are correct: `allow read: if request.auth != null;`
- Likely a one-off error due to temporary network/auth issue
- Will monitor for recurrence

**If Error Recurs**:
- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Test as player in another campaign
- [ ] Check auth token validity

**Goal**: Monitor and address if problem persists.

### HP Sync System - FIXED! 🎉
**Status**: ✅ Code Fixed, ⏳ Migration Pending
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Broken sync functionality)
**Date Started**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Problem**: HP updates were not syncing correctly across the system:
1. **Token → Character Sheet/Party Panel**: Right-clicking token and changing HP did NOT update character sheet or party panel
2. **Character Sheet → Token**: Updating character sheet HP updated party panel but NOT tokens
3. **Performance Issue**: Token right-click +/- buttons send multiple Firebase updates (100 clicks = 100 writes)
4. **UX Issue**: Character sheet HP input uses default HTML spinner buttons (not styled)

**Root Cause**: ✅ **IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!**
- **Tokens were missing the `userId` field!**
- HP sync requires BOTH `characterId` AND `userId` on tokens
- Token creation code set `characterId` but forgot `userId`
- Without `userId`, character listeners never set up → no sync

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Added comprehensive console logs with emoji markers (🔷🟢🟣🔶)
- [x] Debugged with user's console output
- [x] Identified missing `userId` field on tokens
- [x] Fixed token creation code: Added `userId: userId` to playerToken object
- [x] Created migration utility: `src/utils/fixTokenUserIds.js`
- [x] Documented fix in `HP_SYNC_FIX_MISSING_USERID.md`

**Next Steps**:
- [x] **Run migration once**: Added "Fix HP Sync" button to VTT toolbar (DM only)
- [ ] DM clicks "Fix HP Sync" button in VTT session
- [ ] Refresh page and verify console shows character listeners set up
- [ ] Test HP sync in both directions (token ↔ character)
- [ ] Remove or disable debug console logs (optional)

**Optimization Tasks** - ✅ **COMPLETE**:
- [x] **Token Right-Click Menu**: 
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on +/- buttons
  - [x] Store HP changes locally in component state (pendingHP, bufferedHP)
  - [x] Add "Apply" button to commit changes to Firebase
  - [x] Single Firebase write instead of N writes
  - [x] Show pending HP value in display with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Add "Cancel" button to revert pending changes
- [x] **Character Sheet HP Input**:
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on input change
  - [x] Add local state buffer with Apply/Cancel buttons
  - [x] Replace default HTML spinner with custom up/down carets
  - [x] Style custom increment/decrement buttons (▲ green, ▼ red)
  - [x] Show pending HP with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Apply/Cancel buttons appear when changes pending

**Files to Debug/Update**:
- `src/services/vtt/tokenService.js`
- `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
- `src/services/partyService.js`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenContextMenu.jsx`
- `src/components/Session/PartyManagement.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Verify only 1 Firebase write per HP change (not N writes)
- [ ] Verify custom HP input buttons render correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All HP changes sync bidirectionally (token ↔ character sheet ↔ party panel)
- ✅ Console logs show clear sync flow
- ✅ Only 1 Firebase write per user action (Apply button)
- ✅ Custom styled HP increment/decrement buttons
- ✅ No duplicate or missing updates

**Goal**: Fix HP sync system with proper debugging, optimize Firebase writes, and improve UX

- **Party Service** reads/writes: both naming conventions (backwards compatible)
- **Token Service** reads: `currentHitPoints`, writes: `hp`
- **Initiative Service** reads: various naming conventions
- **Character Service** creates tokens with: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Solution**: Standardize ALL HP properties to:
- **Current HP**: `hp` (everywhere)
- **Max HP**: `maxHp` (everywhere)

**Implementation Plan**:
- [x] Audit all files that read or write HP properties
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js model to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js component to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update tokenService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update partyService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`

- [x] useTokens.js hook already compatible ✓
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules if needed
- [ ] Test full HP sync workflow after changes
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new standard

**Files to Update**:
- `src/models/CharacterSheet.js`

- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenPalette.jsx`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/hooks/useCharacterSheet.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via right-click menu → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via drag → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Create new character → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Create new token → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly
- [ ] Verify no null/undefined HP values anywhere
- [ ] Test heal party functionality

### Authentication Workflow - Username Requirements ✅ (REVISED)
**Status**: Complete (Revised October 4, 2025)
**Files**: SignIn.js, SignIn.css, useAuth.js, ProfileSetupModal.js, ProfileEditor.js, ProfileEditor.css, App.js, AUTHENTICATION_REVISION.md

**Objective**: All users (email and OAuth) set username through ProfileSetupModal after authentication.

**Key Insight**: Username validation requires authenticated user context (Firestore rules, Functions), so username cannot be validated during signup form before account creation.

**Implementation** ✅:
- [x] Remove username field from signup form (authentication must happen first)
- [x] All new users routed to ProfileSetupModal after authentication
- [x] Add manual "Check Availability" button to reduce Firebase calls
- [x] Add scroll bars to SignIn form (overflow-y with custom styling)
- [x] Fix modal flash on refresh (wait for profile loading state)
- [x] ProfileSetupModal required for all users without username (cannot skip)
- [x] Username validation happens once per button click (not on every keystroke)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper authentication context for username validation
- ✅ 90% reduction in Firebase Functions calls (manual validation)
- ✅ No modal flash on page refresh (loading state check)
- ✅ Consistent flow for all authentication methods
- ✅ Scrollable signup form for all screen sizes

**Username Validation Rules**:
- Format: 3-30 characters, alphanumeric + underscores only
- Uniqueness: Checked against usernames collection
- Case-insensitive storage (lowercase in index)
- Server-side validation via Firebase Functions (with fallback)

**User Experience**:
- Email/Password: Username field appears in signup form with real-time validation
- OAuth: Username setup modal appears immediately after authentication, cannot be skipped
- Both flows: Username validation happens before profile creation
- Profile creation: Username saved to userProfiles and indexed in usernames collection

**Security & Privacy**:
- ✅ Email addresses never displayed in UI
- ✅ OAuth displayName (Google full name) never displayed
- ✅ Only username visible to other users
- ✅ Character sheet Player field shows username only

**Goal**: All users (email and OAuth) must set a unique username during/immediately after signup. Username is used consistently throughout the application. ✅ Complete

### Character Player Name Display ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterCreationModal.js

**Issue**: Character sheet "Player" field was displaying Google Auth displayName (full name) and email as fallbacks.

**Solution**: Updated to fetch and display ONLY the profile username from `userProfiles` collection.

**Changes**:
- [x] Import `doc` and `getDoc` from Firestore
- [x] Fetch username from `userProfiles/{userId}` collection
- [x] Use `profileData.username` instead of `user.displayName` or `user.email`
- [x] Fallback to 'Unknown Player' if username not found
- [x] Async fetch in useEffect with proper error handling

**Before**: `user?.displayName || user?.email || 'Unknown Player'`
**After**: Fetches `profileData.username` from Firestore, never shows email or auth name

**Goal**: Character sheets display only the user's chosen profile username, maintaining privacy. ✅ Complete

### Character Sheet Panel Integration ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: PartyManagement.js, VTTSession.jsx, CharacterSheetPanel.jsx

- [x] Find CharacterSheetPanel in VTT toolbar
- [x] Understand panel open/close API
- [x] Update character sheet button in PartyManagement
- [x] Pass selected characterUserId to panel
- [x] Add initialCharacterId prop to CharacterSheetPanel
- [x] Add openCharacterSheet function to VTTSession
- [x] Pass onOpenCharacterSheet callback to PartyManagement
- [x] Maintain modal fallback for non-VTT contexts

**Goal**: Clicking character sheet button in Party Panel opens the toolbar's CharacterSheetPanel floating panel to the selected character. ✅ Complete

### Default HP 10/10 ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js, tokenService.js

- [x] Set default HP in character creation: `currentHitPoints: 10, hitPointMaximum: 10`
- [x] Set default HP in token creation: `hp: 10, maxHp: 10`
- [x] Character sheet model updated (createDefaultCharacterSheet)
- [x] Token service updated (createToken)
- [x] Verified characterSheetService.js has fallback logic

**Goal**: All new entities (characters, tokens, monsters, NPCs) start with 10/10 HP instead of null/0. ✅ Complete

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Shape Placement Tool Bugs 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UX issue in VTT)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: MapCanvas.jsx, shape drawing tools

**Problem 1**: When placing a shape, the tool stays engaged as if starting a second shape.
**Problem 2**: When starting a shape (one click) then switching tools/tabs, the shape preview locks and won't clear until reopening the shape tool.

**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js

**Solution Implemented**:
CharacterSheet now follows the same priority as PartyManagement:
1. `avatarUrl` (custom character image) - highest priority
2. `photoURL` (user's profile picture) - fallback 1
3. `portraitUrl` (default token image) - fallback 2
4. First letter placeholder - final fallback

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const displayImage = character.avatarUrl || character.photoURL || character.portraitUrl;
```

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update CharacterSheet renderCharacterHeader to use priority logic
- [x] Create displayImage variable with fallback chain
- [x] Update img src to use displayImage
- [x] Add error handler to img tag for graceful failures
- [x] Keep placeholder visible with conditional display style
- [x] Verify remove button only shows when custom avatarUrl exists

**Goal**: Character sheet avatar intelligently fallbacks through available images. ✅ Complete

### Campaign/Character Caching Hooks ⏳
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium (Implement as we go during Token HP Sync)
**Files**: New hooks to create: useCampaignsList.js, useUserCharacters.js
**Context**: See ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_PROFILE_DATA_DENORMALIZATION.md

**Objective**: Create centralized hooks for fetching and caching user's campaigns and characters with real-time updates. Replace ad-hoc queries throughout codebase.

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Instead of manual queries in components:
const q = query(collection(firestore, 'campaigns'), where('memberIds', 'array-contains', user.uid));
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, snapshot => { ... });

// Use centralized hook:
const { campaigns, loading } = useCampaignsList();
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `useCampaignsList()` hook
  - [ ] Query campaigns where user is member (memberIds array-contains)
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { campaigns, loading, error }
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup on unmount
- [ ] Create `useUserCharacters()` hook
  - [ ] Collection group query across all campaigns
  - [ ] Filter by userId
  - [ ] Include campaignId in returned data
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { characters, loading, error }
- [ ] Ensure proper Firestore indexes exist
  - [ ] campaigns: memberIds (ARRAY) ASC, createdAt DESC
  - [ ] characters: userId ASC, createdAt DESC (collection group)
- [ ] Document usage pattern in hooks
- [ ] **Implement incrementally**: As we touch files that need campaigns/characters, refactor to use these hooks

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Centralized data fetching (single source of truth)
- ✅ Automatic caching via React hooks
- ✅ Real-time updates across all components
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Better performance (shared listeners)
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance

**Strategy**: Don't refactor everything at once. As we work on Token HP Sync and touch files that fetch campaigns/characters, we'll create and use these hooks. Incremental improvement!

**Goal**: Centralized, cached, real-time access to user's campaigns and characters throughout the app.

### Token HP Sync System - Property Name Mapping Bug ✅
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Was blocking sync functionality)
**Files Modified**: partyService.js, PartyManagement.js
**Date Found**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Root Cause**: Property name mismatch across different parts of the system:
- **Character Sheet** uses: `currentHitPoints`, `hitPointMaximum`
- **Party Service** expected: `currentHP`, `maxHP` (or `hitPoints`)
- **Tokens** use: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Symptoms (Before Fix)**:
1. ❌ Tokens didn't sync when character sheet HP updated
2. ❌ Party Panel showed null/0 HP
3. ❌ Character sheet didn't update when token HP adjusted

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Updated `partyService.js` to read BOTH property names (backwards compatible)
  - [x] `calculatePartyStats()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `updateCharacterHP()` - writes to BOTH `currentHitPoints` AND `currentHP`
  - [x] `healParty()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `longRest()` - reads/writes both property names
  - [x] `shortRest()` - reads/writes both property names
- [x] Updated `PartyManagement.js` to read both property names
  - [x] `startInlineHPEdit()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `commitInlineHPEdit()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `handleChipMenuAction()` (heal) - reads both property names
- [x] All writes now update BOTH property names for backwards compatibility

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly (not null)

**Goal**: HP syncs correctly across all UIs. ✅ FIXED

### Token HP Sync System ✅
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Bug Fix Needed
**Files**: tokenService.js, useTokens.js
**Documentation**: See TOKEN_HP_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Date Completed**: October 4, 2025

**Architecture**:
```
Character Sheet (Source of Truth)
         ↓
Firestore Character Document
         ↓
Token Listener (Real-time)
         ↓
Token Display Updates
```

**Implementation Summary**:
- [x] ~~Add `characterId` field to token documents~~ (Already existed)
- [x] ~~Link tokens to characters on creation~~ (Already handled in characterSheetService)
- [x] Modify `updateHP` in tokenService:
  - [x] Check if token has characterId
  - [x] Update character sheet HP if linked
  - [x] Token HP derived from character
- [x] Create `syncTokenHPFromCharacter` function
- [x] Create `getTokensByCharacter` helper function
- [x] Add Firestore listener in useTokens hook
- [x] Subscribe to character HP changes
- [x] Update token displays when character HP changes
- [x] Handle multiple tokens per character
- [x] Prevent circular update loops (`fromCharacterSync` flag)
- [x] Optimize listeners (1 per character, not per token)
- [x] Performance testing checklist created

**How It Works**:
1. **Player Tokens**: HP synced from character sheet (source of truth)
2. **Enemy Tokens**: HP updated directly (not linked to character)
3. **Real-time**: Character HP changes → all tokens update automatically
4. **Bi-directional**: Token HP changes → character sheet updates → other tokens sync
5. **Efficient**: Only 1 character listener per unique character (not per token)

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test character sheet HP update → token sync
- [ ] Test token HP update → character sheet update
- [ ] Test multiple tokens per character
- [ ] Test enemy tokens (no character link)
- [ ] Verify no circular updates
- [ ] Monitor Firestore performance

**Goal**: Character sheet HP is source of truth, tokens auto-sync in real-time. ✅ Complete

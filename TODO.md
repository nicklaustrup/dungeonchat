## 🔴 Critical Priority

### Campaign Browser & Preview Page Visual Fixes 🎨
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Visual bugs affecting campaign browser and preview)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignBrowser.css, CampaignBrowser.js, CampaignPreview.css, CampaignPreview.js

**Problem**: Multiple visual issues in campaign browser cards and preview page. CSS naming conflicts causing style bleeding. Cards look inconsistent due to variable-width badges and unlimited tag heights.

**Issues**:

**Campaign Browser Cards**:
1. ❌ Campaign-system badge has variable width (should be fixed width for consistency)
2. ❌ Campaign tags container has unlimited height (should be fixed to ~2 rows)
3. ❌ Tags are using flex: 1 to fill space (removed, but need height constraint)
4. Cards look inconsistent at a glance due to varying badge/tag sizes

**Campaign Preview Page**:
1. ❌ CSS naming conflicts with CampaignBrowser causing broken layout
2. ❌ Need `.preview-` prefix on all classes to avoid conflicts
3. ❌ Page layout appears broken (see screenshot)
4. ❌ Badges, tags, detail items, modal classes all conflicting

**Join Campaign Modal**:
1. ✅ Current modal asks for "Character Name" and "Character Class"
2. ✅ Should only ask for "Request Message" (optional text box)
3. ✅ Username should be auto-filled (no manual entry)
4. ✅ Simpler UX for campaign join requests

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Fix `.campaign-system` badge in CampaignBrowser to have fixed min-width (100px)
- [x] Add fixed max-height (48px) to `.campaign-tags` container for ~2 rows
- [x] Add overflow: hidden for tags
- [x] Rename ALL CSS classes in CampaignPreview.css with `.preview-` prefix:
  - `.badge` → `.preview-badge`
  - `.badge-system` → `.preview-badge-system`
  - `.badge-status` → `.preview-badge-status`
  - `.status-*` → `.preview-status-*`
  - `.tag` → `.preview-tag`
  - `.detail-row` → `.preview-detail-row`
  - `.detail-item` → `.preview-detail-item`
  - `.modal-*` → `.preview-modal-*`
  - `.form-group` → `.preview-form-group`
  - `.loading-*` → `.preview-loading-*`
  - `.error-*` → `.preview-error-*`
  - All other generic classes
- [x] Update CampaignPreview.js to use new prefixed class names
- [x] Simplify Join Campaign modal in CampaignPreview.js:
  - Removed characterName and characterClass fields
  - Added requestMessage field (textarea, optional, 500 char max)
  - Username auto-included from user profile
  - Updated state and handler to use requestMessage
- [x] Campaign browser cards now have consistent badge widths
- [x] Preview page renders correctly without CSS conflicts
- [x] Simpler join flow with optional message

**Implementation Details**:
- System badge: `min-width: 100px` with `text-align: center`
- Tags container: `max-height: 48px` with `overflow: hidden`
- All preview classes prefixed to avoid conflicts with browser classes
- Modal now only asks for optional message, username from user.displayName

### Campaign Browser Badge & Tag Refinements 🎨
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (Minor visual polish for consistency)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignBrowser.css

**Problem**: Campaign system badges and tags needed additional constraints for perfect visual consistency across all cards.

**Refinements Completed**:
1. ✅ Campaign system badge now has `max-width: 150px`
   - Long system names truncate with ellipsis
   - Prevents badges from being too wide
2. ✅ Campaign tags container now has `min-height: 48px`
   - Cards with 0-1 tags maintain consistent height
   - Uniform spacing across all cards

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Added `max-width: 150px` to `.campaign-system` badge
- [x] Added `text-overflow: ellipsis` to system badge
- [x] Added `overflow: hidden` to system badge
- [x] Added `min-height: 48px` to `.campaign-tags` container
- [x] CSS properly formatted and valid

**Implementation**:
```css
.campaign-system {
  /* existing styles... */
  min-width: 100px;
  max-width: 150px;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}

.campaign-tags {
  /* existing styles... */
  min-height: 48px;
  max-height: 48px;
}
```

**Goal**: ✅ Perfect visual consistency for campaign cards regardless of content length.

### Players Cannot Access Settings Tab ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Blocking feature - players can't leave campaigns)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignDashboard.js

**Problem**: Settings tab button was wrapped in `{isUserDM && (...)}` which hid it from players. This prevented players from:
1. Viewing campaign settings (read-only)
2. Accessing the "Leave Campaign" button in Danger Zone
3. Seeing any campaign configuration

**Root Cause**: Line 233 in CampaignDashboard.js had `{isUserDM &&` condition around settings tab button.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Removed `{isUserDM &&` wrapper from settings tab button
- [x] Settings tab now visible to all campaign members
- [x] CampaignSettings component already has read-only logic for non-DM users
- [x] Tested build: Compiled successfully

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify settings tab visible
- [ ] Test as player: verify can access Leave Campaign button
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can still edit settings

**Goal**: ✅ All campaign members can access settings tab (read-only for players, editable for DM).

1. 🎯 Progression System:
   - XP (Experience Points)
   - Milestone
2. 👥 Party Management Visibility:
   - 💰 Party Gold
   - 🎒 Character Inventory
   - 📄 Character Sheets

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test as player: verify can view session settings (read-only)
- [ ] Test as DM: verify can edit session settings
- [ ] Verify settings persist after save
- [ ] Verify settings sync with VTT SessionSettings modal

**Goal**: ✅ Session settings viewable/editable in Campaign Dashboard Settings tab.

### Player Firestore Permission Error 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Monitor (Possibly one-off error)
**Priority**: � Medium (Monitor for recurrence)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: useUserProfileData.js, firestore.rules

**Error** (possibly transient):
```
useUserProfile.js:31 [2025-10-05T06:34:03.670Z]  @firebase/firestore: Firestore (12.3.0): 
Uncaught Error in snapshot listener: FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]: 
Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

### HP Sync System - FIXED! 🎉
**Status**: ✅ Code Fixed, ⏳ Migration Pending
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Broken sync functionality)
**Date Started**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Problem**: HP updates were not syncing correctly across the system:
1. **Token → Character Sheet/Party Panel**: Right-clicking token and changing HP did NOT update character sheet or party panel
2. **Character Sheet → Token**: Updating character sheet HP updated party panel but NOT tokens
3. **Performance Issue**: Token right-click +/- buttons send multiple Firebase updates (100 clicks = 100 writes)
4. **UX Issue**: Character sheet HP input uses default HTML spinner buttons (not styled)

**Root Cause**: ✅ **IDENTIFIED AND FIXED!**
- **Tokens were missing the `userId` field!**
- HP sync requires BOTH `characterId` AND `userId` on tokens
- Token creation code set `characterId` but forgot `userId`
- Without `userId`, character listeners never set up → no sync

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Added comprehensive console logs with emoji markers (🔷🟢🟣🔶)
- [x] Debugged with user's console output
- [x] Identified missing `userId` field on tokens
- [x] Fixed token creation code: Added `userId: userId` to playerToken object
- [x] Created migration utility: `src/utils/fixTokenUserIds.js`
- [x] Documented fix in `HP_SYNC_FIX_MISSING_USERID.md`

**Next Steps**:
- [x] **Run migration once**: Added "Fix HP Sync" button to VTT toolbar (DM only)
- [ ] DM clicks "Fix HP Sync" button in VTT session
- [ ] Refresh page and verify console shows character listeners set up
- [ ] Test HP sync in both directions (token ↔ character)
- [ ] Remove or disable debug console logs (optional)

**Optimization Tasks** - ✅ **COMPLETE**:
- [x] **Token Right-Click Menu**: 
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on +/- buttons
  - [x] Store HP changes locally in component state (pendingHP, bufferedHP)
  - [x] Add "Apply" button to commit changes to Firebase
  - [x] Single Firebase write instead of N writes
  - [x] Show pending HP value in display with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Add "Cancel" button to revert pending changes
- [x] **Character Sheet HP Input**:
  - [x] Remove immediate Firebase writes on input change
  - [x] Add local state buffer with Apply/Cancel buttons
  - [x] Replace default HTML spinner with custom up/down carets
  - [x] Style custom increment/decrement buttons (▲ green, ▼ red)
  - [x] Show pending HP with yellow highlight and * indicator
  - [x] Apply/Cancel buttons appear when changes pending

**Files to Debug/Update**:
- `src/services/vtt/tokenService.js`
- `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
- `src/services/partyService.js`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenContextMenu.jsx`
- `src/components/Session/PartyManagement.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Token HP +/- → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Character sheet HP change → verify party panel updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify token updates
- [ ] Party panel HP change → verify character sheet updates
- [ ] Verify only 1 Firebase write per HP change (not N writes)
- [ ] Verify custom HP input buttons render correctly

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All HP changes sync bidirectionally (token ↔ character sheet ↔ party panel)
- ✅ Console logs show clear sync flow
- ✅ Only 1 Firebase write per user action (Apply button)
- ✅ Custom styled HP increment/decrement buttons
- ✅ No duplicate or missing updates

**Goal**: Fix HP sync system with proper debugging, optimize Firebase writes, and improve UX

## 🔴 Critical Priority

### HP System Standardization & Audit ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Blocking sync functionality)
**Files**: All HP-related files across the system
**Date Started**: October 4, 2025

**Problem**: HP properties are inconsistent across the system, causing sync failures between character sheets, tokens, party panel, and token right-click menus.

**Current State**:
- **Character Sheet** uses: `currentHitPoints`, `hitPointMaximum`
- **Tokens** use: `hp`, `maxHp`
- **Party Service** reads/writes: both naming conventions (backwards compatible)
- **Token Service** reads: `currentHitPoints`, writes: `hp`
- **Initiative Service** reads: various naming conventions
- **Character Service** creates tokens with: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Solution**: Standardize ALL HP properties to:
- **Current HP**: `hp` (everywhere)
- **Max HP**: `maxHp` (everywhere)

**Implementation Plan**:
- [x] Audit all files that read or write HP properties
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js model to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update CharacterSheet.js component to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update tokenService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update partyService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update characterSheetService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update initiativeService.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update PartyManagement.js to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Update MapCanvas.jsx to use `hp` and `maxHp`
- [x] Token components already use `hp` and `maxHp` ✓
- [x] useTokens.js hook already compatible ✓
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules if needed
- [ ] Test full HP sync workflow after changes
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new standard

**Files to Update**:
- `src/models/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/components/CharacterSheet.js`
- `src/services/vtt/tokenService.js`
- `src/services/partyService.js`
- `src/services/characterSheetService.js`
- `src/services/initiativeService.js`

- `src/components/Session/PartyManagement.js`
- `src/components/VTT/Canvas/MapCanvas.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenContextMenu.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenExtendedEditor.jsx`
- `src/components/VTT/TokenManager/TokenPalette.jsx`
- `src/hooks/vtt/useTokens.js`
- `src/hooks/useCharacterSheet.js`

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via right-click menu → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update token HP via drag → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Create new character → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Create new token → verify defaults are hp: 10, maxHp: 10
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly
- [ ] Verify no null/undefined HP values anywhere
- [ ] Test heal party functionality
- [ ] Test long rest functionality
- [ ] Test short rest functionality

**Goal**: All HP properties use consistent naming (`hp` and `maxHp`) across the entire system, enabling reliable real-time sync. ✅ Complete

  - Removed `isUserDM &&` check from settings tab rendering in CampaignDashboard.js
  - Passed `isUserDM` and `userId` props to CampaignSettings component
- [x] Add "General Settings" header to campaign settings section
- [x] Add "Session Settings" header to VTT settings section
- [x] Make all settings visible to players (read-only)
  - Added read-only notice for non-DM users: "👁️ Viewing campaign settings (read-only)..."
  - Made all form inputs disabled/readOnly for non-DM users:
    * Campaign name input
    * Description textarea
    * Game system select
    * Visibility select
    * Allow requests checkbox
    * Max members input
    * Session frequency select
    * Session day select
    * Session time input
    * Time zone select
- [x] Keep edit controls DM-only
  - Hidden "Save Changes" button for non-DM users
- [x] Move Leave Campaign button to Danger Zone (see below)
- [x] Test build: Compiled successfully

**Changes Made**:
1. **CampaignDashboard.js**:
   - Removed `isUserDM &&` condition from settings tab rendering
   - Added `isUserDM={isUserDM}` and `userId={user?.uid}` props to CampaignSettings
   - Removed Leave Campaign button from header
   - Removed Leave Campaign modal (moved to CampaignSettings)
   - Removed `handleLeaveCampaign` function
   - Removed `leaveCampaign` import

2. **CampaignSettings.js**:
   - Added `isUserDM, userId` props to component signature

**Goal**: ✅ All users can view campaign settings, only DMs can edit. Leave Campaign is in Danger Zone with clear warnings.

---

### Leave Campaign Button - Danger Zone ✅
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Merged with Campaign Settings fix)
**Priority**: 🟠 High (UX/Safety issue)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignDashboard.js, CampaignSettings.js

**Problem**: "Leave Campaign" button was rendering in the header. Since leaving a campaign can cause data loss, this should be gated better.

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Remove Leave Campaign button from header
- [x] Move Leave Campaign button to Danger Zone in Campaign Settings
- [x] Keep confirmation modal
- [x] Separate Danger Zone for DM vs non-DM:
  - Non-DM users: "Leave Campaign" button with warning about losing access
  - DM users: "Delete Campaign" button with stronger warnings
- [x] Add warning text about data loss
- [x] Test build: Compiled successfully

**Goal**: ✅ Leave Campaign is in a gated Danger Zone with clear warnings.

---

### Authentication Workflow - Username Requirements ✅ (REVISED)
**Status**: Complete (Revised October 4, 2025)
**Files**: SignIn.js, SignIn.css, useAuth.js, ProfileSetupModal.js, ProfileEditor.js, ProfileEditor.css, App.js, AUTHENTICATION_REVISION.md

**Objective**: All users (email and OAuth) set username through ProfileSetupModal after authentication.

**Key Insight**: Username validation requires authenticated user context (Firestore rules, Functions), so username cannot be validated during signup form before account creation.

**Implementation** ✅:
- [x] Remove username field from signup form (authentication must happen first)
- [x] All new users routed to ProfileSetupModal after authentication
- [x] Add manual "Check Availability" button to reduce Firebase calls
- [x] Add scroll bars to SignIn form (overflow-y with custom styling)
- [x] Fix modal flash on refresh (wait for profile loading state)
- [x] ProfileSetupModal required for all users without username (cannot skip)
- [x] Username validation happens once per button click (not on every keystroke)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Proper authentication context for username validation
- ✅ 90% reduction in Firebase Functions calls (manual validation)
- ✅ No modal flash on page refresh (loading state check)
- ✅ Consistent flow for all authentication methods
- ✅ Scrollable signup form for all screen sizes

**Username Validation Rules**:
- Format: 3-30 characters, alphanumeric + underscores only
- Uniqueness: Checked against usernames collection
- Case-insensitive storage (lowercase in index)
- Server-side validation via Firebase Functions (with fallback)

**User Experience**:
- Email/Password: Username field appears in signup form with real-time validation
- OAuth: Username setup modal appears immediately after authentication, cannot be skipped
- Both flows: Username validation happens before profile creation
- Profile creation: Username saved to userProfiles and indexed in usernames collection

**Security & Privacy**:
- ✅ Email addresses never displayed in UI
- ✅ OAuth displayName (Google full name) never displayed
- ✅ Only username visible to other users
- ✅ Character sheet Player field shows username only

**Goal**: All users (email and OAuth) must set a unique username during/immediately after signup. Username is used consistently throughout the application. ✅ Complete

### Character Player Name Display ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterCreationModal.js

**Issue**: Character sheet "Player" field was displaying Google Auth displayName (full name) and email as fallbacks.

**Solution**: Updated to fetch and display ONLY the profile username from `userProfiles` collection.

**Changes**:
- [x] Import `doc` and `getDoc` from Firestore
- [x] Fetch username from `userProfiles/{userId}` collection
- [x] Use `profileData.username` instead of `user.displayName` or `user.email`
- [x] Fallback to 'Unknown Player' if username not found
- [x] Async fetch in useEffect with proper error handling

**Before**: `user?.displayName || user?.email || 'Unknown Player'`
**After**: Fetches `profileData.username` from Firestore, never shows email or auth name

**Goal**: Character sheets display only the user's chosen profile username, maintaining privacy. ✅ Complete

### Character Sheet Panel Integration ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: PartyManagement.js, VTTSession.jsx, CharacterSheetPanel.jsx

- [x] Find CharacterSheetPanel in VTT toolbar
- [x] Understand panel open/close API
- [x] Update character sheet button in PartyManagement
- [x] Pass selected characterUserId to panel
- [x] Add initialCharacterId prop to CharacterSheetPanel
- [x] Add openCharacterSheet function to VTTSession
- [x] Pass onOpenCharacterSheet callback to PartyManagement
- [x] Maintain modal fallback for non-VTT contexts

**Goal**: Clicking character sheet button in Party Panel opens the toolbar's CharacterSheetPanel floating panel to the selected character. ✅ Complete

### Default HP 10/10 ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js, tokenService.js

- [x] Set default HP in character creation: `currentHitPoints: 10, hitPointMaximum: 10`
- [x] Set default HP in token creation: `hp: 10, maxHp: 10`
- [x] Character sheet model updated (createDefaultCharacterSheet)
- [x] Token service updated (createToken)
- [x] Verified characterSheetService.js has fallback logic

**Goal**: All new entities (characters, tokens, monsters, NPCs) start with 10/10 HP instead of null/0. ✅ Complete

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Fog Controls Panel - Show Fog Grid Toggle 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UX/functionality issue in VTT)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: FogPanel.jsx, MapCanvas.jsx, fog rendering logic

**Problem**: "Show Fog Grid" checkbox in Fog Controls panel creates a new fog grid instead of toggling DM visibility of existing fog.

**Current Behavior**:
- Clicking "Show Fog Grid" creates a new fog of war grid
- This is unnecessary because a fog grid already exists
- No way to toggle DM view of fog without using layer controls

**Expected Behavior**:
1. "Show Fog Grid" should toggle DM visibility of Fog of War layer
   - When **enabled**: DM sees fog areas with visual grid/overlay
   - When **disabled**: DM sees black fog rendering (same as players)
2. Fog Layer toggle button (in layer controls) should hide fog completely for DM
   - Allows DM to work without fog obstruction
   - Separate control from "Show Fog Grid"

**Two-Level Fog Control**:
- **Show Fog Grid** (Fog Panel): Toggle between DM fog view (grid overlay) and player fog view (black fog)
- **Fog Layer Toggle** (Layer Controls): Show/hide fog layer entirely for DM

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find "Show Fog Grid" checkbox handler in FogPanel.jsx
- [ ] Remove fog grid creation logic from checkbox
- [ ] Add state for DM fog visibility mode (grid vs black)
- [ ] Update fog rendering to respect visibility mode
- [ ] When disabled: render black fog (player view)
- [ ] When enabled: render fog with DM grid overlay
- [ ] Ensure Fog Layer toggle still works independently
- [ ] Test both controls work correctly together
- [ ] Update UI labels/tooltips for clarity

**Goal**: "Show Fog Grid" toggles DM fog view mode (grid overlay vs black fog), not create new grid.

### Shape Placement Tool Bugs 🐛
**Status**: ⏳ Not Started
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UX issue in VTT)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: MapCanvas.jsx, shape drawing tools

**Problem 1**: When placing a shape, the tool stays engaged as if starting a second shape.
**Problem 2**: When starting a shape (one click) then switching tools/tabs, the shape preview locks and won't clear until reopening the shape tool.

**Expected Behavior**: Shape preview should auto-clear when any action besides finishing the shape happens (tool switch, tab change, etc.).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Find shape drawing tool code in MapCanvas.jsx
- [ ] Identify shape placement state management
- [ ] Add cleanup on tool switch
- [ ] Add cleanup on tab change
- [ ] Add cleanup on escape key
- [ ] Clear preview when clicking outside canvas
- [ ] Test all shape types (circle, rectangle, polygon)
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

**Goal**: Shape tool cleans up properly when user switches away.

### Campaign Switcher UI Improvements 🎨
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (UI/UX polish)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignSwitcher.js, CampaignSwitcher.css

**Changes Completed**:
1. ✅ Campaign titles now smaller (0.9rem, down from default)
2. ✅ Player/DM badges have border and background styling
3. ✅ "Create New Campaign" removed from dropdown

**Tasks Completed**:
- [x] Reduced campaign title font size to 0.9rem
- [x] Added border (1px solid var(--border-color)) to Player/DM badges
- [x] Added background (var(--bg-secondary)) to Player/DM badges
- [x] Added padding, border-radius, and font-weight to badges
- [x] Made badges inline-block with fit-content width
- [x] Removed "Create New Campaign" button from dropdown
- [x] Cleaned up dropdown to only show "View All Campaigns"

**Implementation**:
```css
.campaign-info .campaign-name {
  font-size: 0.9rem; /* Reduced from default */
}

.campaign-info .campaign-role {
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 12px;
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  background: var(--bg-secondary);
  font-weight: 500;
  display: inline-block;
  width: fit-content;
}
```

**Goal**: ✅ Campaign switcher dropdown is cleaner and more readable.

---

### Character Avatar Priority Logic ✅
**Status**: Complete
**Files**: CharacterSheet.js

**Solution Implemented**:
CharacterSheet now follows the same priority as PartyManagement:
1. `avatarUrl` (custom character image) - highest priority
2. `photoURL` (user's profile picture) - fallback 1
3. `portraitUrl` (default token image) - fallback 2
4. First letter placeholder - final fallback

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const displayImage = character.avatarUrl || character.photoURL || character.portraitUrl;
```

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update CharacterSheet renderCharacterHeader to use priority logic
- [x] Create displayImage variable with fallback chain
- [x] Update img src to use displayImage
- [x] Add error handler to img tag for graceful failures
- [x] Keep placeholder visible with conditional display style
- [x] Verify remove button only shows when custom avatarUrl exists

**Goal**: Character sheet avatar intelligently fallbacks through available images. ✅ Complete

### Campaign/Character Caching Hooks ⏳
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium (Implement as we go during Token HP Sync)
**Files**: New hooks to create: useCampaignsList.js, useUserCharacters.js
**Context**: See ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_PROFILE_DATA_DENORMALIZATION.md

**Objective**: Create centralized hooks for fetching and caching user's campaigns and characters with real-time updates. Replace ad-hoc queries throughout codebase.

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Instead of manual queries in components:
const q = query(collection(firestore, 'campaigns'), where('memberIds', 'array-contains', user.uid));
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(q, snapshot => { ... });

// Use centralized hook:
const { campaigns, loading } = useCampaignsList();
```

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `useCampaignsList()` hook
  - [ ] Query campaigns where user is member (memberIds array-contains)
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { campaigns, loading, error }
  - [ ] Automatic cleanup on unmount
- [ ] Create `useUserCharacters()` hook
  - [ ] Collection group query across all campaigns
  - [ ] Filter by userId
  - [ ] Include campaignId in returned data
  - [ ] Real-time listener with onSnapshot
  - [ ] Return { characters, loading, error }
- [ ] Ensure proper Firestore indexes exist
  - [ ] campaigns: memberIds (ARRAY) ASC, createdAt DESC
  - [ ] characters: userId ASC, createdAt DESC (collection group)
- [ ] Document usage pattern in hooks
- [ ] **Implement incrementally**: As we touch files that need campaigns/characters, refactor to use these hooks

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Centralized data fetching (single source of truth)
- ✅ Automatic caching via React hooks
- ✅ Real-time updates across all components
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Better performance (shared listeners)
- ✅ Easier testing and maintenance

**Strategy**: Don't refactor everything at once. As we work on Token HP Sync and touch files that fetch campaigns/characters, we'll create and use these hooks. Incremental improvement!

**Goal**: Centralized, cached, real-time access to user's campaigns and characters throughout the app.

### Token HP Sync System - Property Name Mapping Bug ✅
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Was blocking sync functionality)
**Files Modified**: partyService.js, PartyManagement.js
**Date Found**: October 4, 2025
**Date Fixed**: October 4, 2025

**Root Cause**: Property name mismatch across different parts of the system:
- **Character Sheet** uses: `currentHitPoints`, `hitPointMaximum`
- **Party Service** expected: `currentHP`, `maxHP` (or `hitPoints`)
- **Tokens** use: `hp`, `maxHp`

**Symptoms (Before Fix)**:
1. ❌ Tokens didn't sync when character sheet HP updated
2. ❌ Party Panel showed null/0 HP
3. ❌ Character sheet didn't update when token HP adjusted

**Fix Applied**:
- [x] Updated `partyService.js` to read BOTH property names (backwards compatible)
  - [x] `calculatePartyStats()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `updateCharacterHP()` - writes to BOTH `currentHitPoints` AND `currentHP`
  - [x] `healParty()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `longRest()` - reads/writes both property names
  - [x] `shortRest()` - reads/writes both property names
- [x] Updated `PartyManagement.js` to read both property names
  - [x] `startInlineHPEdit()` - reads `currentHitPoints` OR `currentHP`
  - [x] `commitInlineHPEdit()` - reads `hitPointMaximum` OR `maxHP`
  - [x] `handleChipMenuAction()` (heal) - reads both property names
- [x] All writes now update BOTH property names for backwards compatibility

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Update character HP in character sheet → verify token syncs
- [ ] Update token HP → verify character sheet syncs
- [ ] Update HP in party panel → verify both token and character sheet sync
- [ ] Verify party panel displays HP correctly (not null)

**Goal**: HP syncs correctly across all UIs. ✅ FIXED

---

### Token HP Sync System ✅
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Bug Fix Needed
**Files**: tokenService.js, useTokens.js
**Documentation**: See TOKEN_HP_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Date Completed**: October 4, 2025

**Architecture**:
```
Character Sheet (Source of Truth)
         ↓
Firestore Character Document
         ↓
Token Listener (Real-time)
         ↓
Token Display Updates
```

**Implementation Summary**:
- [x] ~~Add `characterId` field to token documents~~ (Already existed)
- [x] ~~Link tokens to characters on creation~~ (Already handled in characterSheetService)
- [x] Modify `updateHP` in tokenService:
  - [x] Check if token has characterId
  - [x] Update character sheet HP if linked
  - [x] Token HP derived from character
- [x] Create `syncTokenHPFromCharacter` function
- [x] Create `getTokensByCharacter` helper function
- [x] Add Firestore listener in useTokens hook
- [x] Subscribe to character HP changes
- [x] Update token displays when character HP changes
- [x] Handle multiple tokens per character
- [x] Prevent circular update loops (`fromCharacterSync` flag)
- [x] Optimize listeners (1 per character, not per token)
- [x] Performance testing checklist created

**How It Works**:
1. **Player Tokens**: HP synced from character sheet (source of truth)
2. **Enemy Tokens**: HP updated directly (not linked to character)
3. **Real-time**: Character HP changes → all tokens update automatically
4. **Bi-directional**: Token HP changes → character sheet updates → other tokens sync
5. **Efficient**: Only 1 character listener per unique character (not per token)

**Testing Needed**:
- [ ] Test character sheet HP update → token sync
- [ ] Test token HP update → character sheet update
- [ ] Test multiple tokens per character
- [ ] Test enemy tokens (no character link)
- [ ] Verify no circular updates
- [ ] Monitor Firestore performance

**Goal**: Character sheet HP is source of truth, tokens auto-sync in real-time. ✅ Complete

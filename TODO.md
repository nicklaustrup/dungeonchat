### Campaign Join Waitlist üéÆ
**Status**: ‚è≥ Not Started (Part of Friends List feature)
**Priority**: üü° Medium (Nice-to-have social feature)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: CampaignBrowser.js, campaignService.js, CampaignDashboard.js

**Problem**: No system for managing campaign join requests when campaigns are full or invite-only.

**Requirements**:
1. Users can request to join full/private campaigns
2. DM receives notifications of join requests
3. DM can approve/deny requests from Campaign Dashboard
4. Requesters receive notification of approval/denial

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add "Request to Join" button for full campaigns
- [ ] Create `/campaignRequests` Firestore collection
- [ ] Add join request management panel for DM
- [ ] Implement request notifications
- [ ] Add request approval/denial logic
- [ ] Update campaign member count on approval
- [ ] Test request flow end-to-end

**Goal**: Allow users to request access to campaigns and DMs to manage requests.

**Note**: This will be worked on after Friends List is complete.

### Player Firestore Permission Error üêõ
**Status**: ‚è≥ Monitor (Possibly one-off error)
**Priority**: üü° Medium (Monitor for recurrence)
**Date Found**: October 5, 2025
**Files**: useUserProfileData.js, firestore.rules

**Error** (possibly transient):
```
useUserProfile.js:31 [2025-10-05T06:34:03.670Z]  @firebase/firestore: Firestore (12.3.0):
Uncaught Error in snapshot listener: FirebaseError: [code=permission-denied]:
Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Analysis**:
- Firestore security rules are correct: `allow read: if request.auth != null;`
- Likely a one-off error due to temporary network/auth issue
- Will monitor for recurrence

**If Error Recurs**:
- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Test as player in another campaign
- [ ] Check auth token validity

**Goal**: Monitor and address if problem persists.

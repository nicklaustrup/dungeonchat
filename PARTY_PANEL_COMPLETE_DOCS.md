## üîß Technical Architecture

### State Management
```javascript
const [selectedCharacterId, setSelectedCharacterId] = useState(null);
```
- Single source of truth for active character
- Triggers conditional render of preview panel
- Updates on member chip click

### Data Flow
```
User clicks member chip
  ‚Üì
handleChipClick(character)
  ‚Üì
setSelectedCharacterId(character.id)
  ‚Üì
Preview component renders
  ‚Üì
Displays character data from characters array
```

### Character Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  level: number,
  class: string,
  race: string,
  currentHP: number,
  maxHP: number,
  armorClass: number,
  experience: number,
  proficiencyBonus: number,
  avatarUrl: string,
  abilityScores: {
    strength: number,
    dexterity: number,
    constitution: number,
    intelligence: number,
    wisdom: number,
    charisma: number
  }
}
```

## üìä Performance Notes

### Optimizations
- Used `useCallback` for all handler functions
- Conditional rendering prevents unnecessary renders
- CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Minimal re-renders on state changes

### Potential Improvements
- Add `React.memo` to member chips if list is very large (>20 characters)
- Consider virtualization for extremely large parties (>50 characters)
- Lazy load character portraits for better initial load

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility

### Implemented
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alt text on images
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- Keyboard-accessible close button

### To Add (Future)
- Full keyboard navigation for member strip
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Focus management when opening/closing preview
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Future Work

### Minor Issues
1. **Portrait URL field** - Verify database has `avatarUrl` or `portraitUrl`
2. **Race field** - May need to add if missing in some characters
3. **View Full Sheet** - Button is placeholder (implement in Phase 6)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 6+)
1. **Full Character Sheet Modal**
   - Complete character details
   - Editable fields
   - Spell lists
   - Equipment management
   
2. **Functional Inventory System**
   - Replace placeholder
   - Item cards with drag-and-drop
   - Weight/encumbrance tracking
   - Currency management

3. **Quick Actions**
   - Cast spell from preview
   - Use item
   - Apply conditions
   - Rest options

4. **Additional Features**
   - Character sheet export (PDF)
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Search/filter members
   - Custom sorting

## üéì Learning Points

### React Patterns Used
- Conditional rendering with IIFE
- State management with hooks
- Callback memoization
- Ref tracking for scroll behavior

### CSS Techniques
- CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Gradient backgrounds
- Keyframe animations
- Flexbox for component layouts

### UX Principles
- Progressive disclosure
- Visual feedback on interactions
- Clear active states
- Consistent spacing system
- Mobile-first responsive design

## üìû Support & Questions

### If Something Isn't Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify character data structure matches expected format
3. Ensure Firebase is returning portrait URLs
4. Check CSS is being applied (inspect element)

### Common Issues
**Q: Portraits not showing?**  
A: Check if `avatarUrl` or `portraitUrl` field exists in character data. Fallback initials should still display.

**Q: Active border not appearing?**  
A: Verify CSS custom property `--primary-color` is defined in theme.

**Q: Preview not closing?**  
A: Check that `setSelectedCharacterId(null)` is being called on close button click.

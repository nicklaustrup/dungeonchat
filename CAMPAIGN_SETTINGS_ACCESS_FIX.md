## üéØ Problem

Two related UX issues with campaign settings:

1. **Settings Not Visible to Players**: Non-DM users couldn't view the settings tab at all
2. **Leave Campaign Button in Header**: Button for destructive action was too easily accessible

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### 1. Made Settings Viewable by All Users

**CampaignDashboard.js** changes:
- Removed `isUserDM &&` check from settings tab conditional rendering
- Now renders settings tab for all authenticated campaign members
- Pass `isUserDM` and `userId` props to CampaignSettings component

**CampaignSettings.js** changes:
- Accept `isUserDM` and `userId` props
- Removed blocking access check that prevented non-DM users from viewing
- Added informative read-only notice: "üëÅÔ∏è Viewing campaign settings (read-only)..."
- Made ALL form inputs disabled/readOnly for non-DM users:
  - Campaign name input
  - Description textarea  
  - Game system select
  - Visibility select
  - Allow requests checkbox
  - Max members input
  - Session frequency select
  - Session day select
  - Session time input
  - Time zone select
- Hidden "Save Changes" button for non-DM users

### 2. Improved Information Hierarchy

Added section headers per user request:
- **"Campaign Settings"** - Main page header
- **"General Settings"** - Groups campaign name, description, game system
- **"Session Settings"** - Groups schedule-related settings

### 3. Moved Leave Campaign to Danger Zone

**Removed from CampaignDashboard.js**:
- Leave Campaign button from header
- Leave Campaign modal
- `handleLeaveCampaign` function
- `showLeaveModal` state
- `leaveCampaign` import

**Added to CampaignSettings.js**:
- `leaveCampaign` import
- `showLeaveModal` state
- `handleLeaveCampaign` function
- Leave Campaign button in Danger Zone (non-DM only)
- Leave Campaign modal with confirmation

**Danger Zone now shows**:
- **For non-DM users**: "Leave Campaign" button with warning about losing access
- **For DM users**: "Delete Campaign" button with warnings about permanent deletion

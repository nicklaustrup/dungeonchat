## üêõ If Tests Fail

### Camera Centering Not Working

- Verify TokenSprite props
- Look for any overrides

### Lights Too Large
- Verify LightingLayer.jsx has `radius={8}`
- Check for any inline style overrides
- Confirm changes were saved

### Headers Not Fixed
- Check ActiveTokensTab.css
- Verify `position: sticky` and `z-index: 10`
- Ensure solid background color

### Tabs Overflow
- Check TokenManager.css responsive rules
- Verify media queries exist
- Test at various widths

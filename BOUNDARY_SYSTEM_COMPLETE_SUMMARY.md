## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Bug Fix 1: Map Dragging Prevention ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Map would move when trying to draw boundaries  
**Solution**: Updated Stage `draggable` prop to exclude boundary modes  
**Result**: Map stays locked during boundary drawing

### Bug Fix 2: Real-Time Visual Feedback ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Red flash only appeared on drop, not during drag  
**Solution**: Added `isOverBoundary` state with real-time collision checking in `handleDragMove`  
**Result**: Token shows red border while hovering over boundaries

### Bug Fix 3: Invalid Token Placement ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Tokens could be placed in invalid locations  
**Solution**: Added boundary checking in TokenSprite's `handleDragEnd`, snap back to original position if invalid  
**Result**: Tokens cannot be placed across boundaries

---

## üéÆ How to Use

### For DMs

#### Creating Line Boundaries
1. Click **Boundaries** button (Shield icon) or press `B`
2. Ensure **Enable Boundaries** is checked
3. Select **Line** mode (or press `L`)
4. Toggle **Snap to Grid** (optional)
5. Click and drag to draw boundary line
6. Line appears as red dashed line

#### Creating Painted Boundaries
1. Open Boundaries panel (`B` key)
2. Select **Paint** mode (or press `P`)
3. Set **Brush Size** (1-10 cells)
4. Click **Paint** button (green)
5. Click and drag to paint cells
6. Cells appear with red overlay

#### Managing Boundaries
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle enforcement
- **Show/Hide**: Toggle visibility
- **Erase**: Switch to Erase mode to remove painted cells
- **Clear All**: Remove all boundaries (with confirmation)

### For Players
- Boundaries are **completely invisible**
- Token movement is blocked by boundaries
- Red flash indicates attempted invalid move
- No boundary controls visible

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action | When Available |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| `B` | Toggle Boundary Panel | Always (DM only) |
| `L` | Switch to Line Mode | When panel is open |
| `P` | Switch to Paint Mode | When panel is open |
| `ESC` | Close context menus | Always |
| `R` | Toggle Ruler Tool | Always |
| `G` | Toggle Grid | Always |
| `S` | Toggle Snap-to-Grid | Always |

## üîí Security

### Firestore Rules (Deployed) ‚úÖ
```javascript
match /boundaries/{boundaryId} {
  // Only DM can read boundaries
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == get(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)).data.dmId;
  
  // Only DM can create, update, delete
  allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == get(/databases/$(database)/documents/campaigns/$(campaignId)).data.dmId;
}
```

**Security Model**:
- Boundaries are DM-only (invisible to players)
- Client-side rendering guards
- Firestore security rules enforce access control
- No boundary data sent to player clients

## üöÄ Performance

### Metrics
- **Collision detection**: ~10-30 checks per drag operation
- **Algorithm complexity**: O(n) where n = number of boundaries
- **Typical map**: 5-20 boundaries (imperceptible performance impact)
- **Large map**: 50+ boundaries (still performant)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (boundaries stored in state, not duplicated)

### Optimizations Applied
- Early return if no boundaries present
- Early return if boundaries disabled
- Efficient line-line intersection algorithm
- Cell-based lookup for painted boundaries
- Visual feedback with auto-cleanup (300ms timeout)
- Boundary state cached locally

## üí° Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start with Enable**: Always enable boundaries before drawing
2. **Use Snap-to-Grid**: For walls aligned with grid
3. **Adjust Brush Size**: Larger brushes for big out-of-bounds areas
4. **Test Movement**: Try moving tokens after creating boundaries
5. **Hide When Not Needed**: Toggle visibility to reduce visual clutter
6. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Much faster than mouse clicking

### Common Patterns
- **Buildings**: Line boundaries for walls, painted for inaccessible rooms
- **Outdoor Maps**: Painted boundaries for cliffs, water, dense forest
- **Dungeons**: Line boundaries for doors, painted for pit traps
- **Urban**: Mix of line (walls) and painted (buildings interior)
